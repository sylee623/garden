  abstract = {Inputs from olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axons expressing the same type of odorant receptor (OR) converge in the glomerulus of the main olfactory bulb. A key marker of mature OSNs is olfactory marker protein (OMP), whose deletion has been associated with deficits in OSN signal transduction and odor discrimination. Here, we investigate glomerular odor responses and anatomical architecture in mice in which one or both alleles of OMP are replaced by the fluorescent synaptic activity reporter, synaptopHluorin. Functionally heterogeneous glomeruli, that is, ones with microdomains with distinct odor responses, are rare in OMP+/-- mice, but occur frequently in OMP--/-- mice. Genetic targeting of single ORs reveals that these microdomains arise from co-innervation of individual glomeruli by OSNs expressing different ORs. This glomerular mistargeting is locally restricted to a few glomerular diameters. Our studies document functional heterogeneity in sensory input within individual glomeruli and uncover its anatomical correlate, revealing an unexpected role for OMP in the formation and refinement of the glomerular map.},

  abstract = {Heat acclimation is an adaptive process that improves physiological performance and supports survival in the face of increasing environmental temperatures, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we identified a discrete group of neurons in the mouse hypothalamic preoptic area (POA) that rheostatically increase their activity over the course of heat acclimation, a property required for mice to become heat tolerant. In non-acclimated mice, peripheral thermoafferent pathways via the parabrachial nucleus activate POA neurons and mediate acute heat-defense mechanisms. However, long-term heat exposure promotes the POA neurons to gain intrinsically warm-sensitive activity, independent of thermoafferent parabrachial input. This newly gained cell-autonomous warm sensitivity is required to recruit peripheral heat tolerance mechanisms in acclimated animals. This pacemaker-like, warm-sensitive activity is driven by a combination of increased sodium leak current and enhanced utilization of the NaV1.3 ion channel. We propose that this salient neuronal plasticity mechanism adaptively drives acclimation to promote heat tolerance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Angelman syndrome (AS), a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by abnormalities of the 15q11.2-q13.1 chromosome region, is characterized by impairment of cognitive and motor functions, sleep problems, and seizures. How the genetic defects of AS produce these neurological symptoms is unclear. Mice modeling AS (AS mice) accumulate activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC/ARG3.1), a neuronal immediate early gene (IEG) critical for synaptic plasticity. This accumulation suggests an altered protein metabolism. METHODS: Focusing on the dorsal hippocampus (dHC), a brain region critical for memory formation and cognitive functions, we assessed levels and tissue distribution of IEGs, de novo protein synthesis, and markers of protein synthesis, endosomes, autophagy, and synaptic functions in AS mice at baseline and following learning. We also tested autophagic flux and memory retention following autophagy-promoting treatment. RESULTS: AS dHC exhibited accumulation of IEGs ARC, FOS, and EGR1; autophagy proteins MLP3B, SQSTM1, and LAMP1; and reduction of the endosomal protein RAB5A. AS dHC also had increased levels of de novo protein synthesis, impaired autophagic flux with accumulation of autophagosome, and altered synaptic protein levels. Contextual fear conditioning significantly increased levels of IEGs and autophagy proteins, de novo protein synthesis, and autophagic flux in the dHC of normal mice, but not in AS mice. Enhancing autophagy in the dHC alleviated ASrelated memory and autophagic flux impairments. CONCLUSIONS: A major biological deficit of AS brain is a defective protein metabolism, particularly that dynamically regulated by learning, resulting in stalled autophagy and accumulation of neuronal proteins. Activating autophagy ameliorates AS cognitive impairments and dHC protein accumulation.},

Human language, which is also culturally transmitted, has statistically coherent parts whose frequency distribution follows a power law. These properties facilitate learning and may therefore arise because of their contribution to the faithful transmission of language over multiple cultural generations. If so, we would expect to find them in other culturally transmitted systems. In this study, we applied methods based on infant speech segmentation to 8 years of humpback recordings, uncovering in whale song the same statistical structure that is a hallmark of human language. This commonality, in two evolutionarily distant species, points to the role of learning and cultural transmission in the emergence of properties thought to be unique to human language.},

Recent advances have also been made in the development of inhibitors that specifically target BCL-XL and myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (MCL1), which are additional BCL-2 family members that have demonstrated roles in cancer.},

Although the disease exhibits marked locus and allelic heterogeneity, with the causal mutations being both rare and private, one causal mutation in the prokineticin receptor, PROKR2 L173R, appears unusually prevalent among GnRH-deficient patients of diverse geographic and ethnic origins. To track the genetic ancestry of PROKR2 L173R, haplotype mapping was performed in 22 unrelated patients with GnRH deficiency carrying L173R and their 30 first-degree relatives. The mutation's age was estimated using a haplotype-decay model. Thirteen subjects were informative and in all of them the mutation was present on the same {$\sim$}123 kb haplotype whose population frequency is {$\leq$}10\%. Thus, PROKR2 L173R represents a founder mutation whose age is estimated at approximately 9000 years. Inheritance of PROKR2 L173R-associated GnRH deficiency was complex with highly variable penetrance among carriers, influenced by additional mutations in the other PROKR2 allele (recessive inheritance) or another gene (digenicity). The paradoxical identification of an ancient founder mutation that impairs reproduction has intriguing implications for the inheritance mechanisms of PROKR2 L173R-associated GnRH deficiency and for the relevant processes of evolutionary selection, including potential selective advantages of mutation carriers in genes affecting reproduction.},

All three homologs stimulate gastrointestinal motility thus accounting for their family name ``prokineticins'' (Schweitz et al., 1990, Schweitz et al., 1999). However, since its initial description, both PROK1 and PROK2 have been found to regulate a dazzling array of biological functions throughout the body. In particular, PROK1 acts as a potent angiogenic mitogen on endocrine vascular epithelium, thus earning its other name, Endocrine gland--vascular endothelial factor (EG--VEGF) (LeCouter et al., 2002). In contrast, the PROK2 signaling pathway is a critical regulator of olfactory bulb morphogenesis and sexual maturation in mammals and this function is the focus of this review.},

In the present study, we combined several single-nucleus genotyping and transcriptomics approaches with spatial resolution in surgical cortical specimens from patients with genetically mosaic FCDII. Mutations were detected in distinct cell types, including glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes, and a small fraction of mutated cells exhibited cytomegalic features. Moreover, we identified cell-type-specific transcriptional dysregulations in both mutated and nonmutated FCDII cells, including synapse- and neurodevelopment-related pathways, that may account for epilepsy and dysregulation of mitochondrial metabolism pathways in cytomegalic cells. Together, these findings reveal cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous features of FCDII that may be leveraged for precision medicine.},

Here, we propose that topographic restrictions in OR expression are established in neuronal progenitors by two opposing forces: polygenic transcription and genomic silencing, both of which are influenced by dorsoventral gradients of transcription factors NFIA, B, and X. Polygenic transcription of OR genes may define spatially constrained OR repertoires, among which one OR allele is selected for singular expression later in development. Heterochromatin assembly and genomic compartmentalization of OR alleles also vary across the axes of the olfactory epithelium and may preferentially eliminate ectopically expressed ORs with more dorsal expression destinations from this `privileged' repertoire. Our experiments identify early transcription as a potential `epigenetic' contributor to future developmental patterning and reveal how two spatially responsive probabilistic processes may act in concert to establish deterministic, precise, and reproducible territories of stochastic gene expression.},

However, with the development of powerful genomic and imaging tools for the analysis of the 3D genome, and with their application on an increasing number of cell types, it becomes apparent that regulated, specific, and functionally important inter-chromosomal contacts exist. Widespread and stereotypic inter-chromosomal interactions are at the center of chemosensation, where they regulate the singular and stochastic expression of olfactory receptor genes. In olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) coalescence of multiple intergenic enhancers to a multi-chromosomal hub orchestrates the expression of a single OR allele, whereas convergence of the remaining OR genes from 18 chromosomes into a few heterochromatic compartments mediates their effective transcriptional silencing. In this review we describe the role of interchromosomal interactions in OR gene choice, and we describe other biological systems where such genomic interactions may contribute to regulatory robustness and transcriptional diversification.}

  abstract = {The basolateral complex of amygdala (BLA) processes emotionally arousing aversive and rewarding experiences. The BLA is critical for acquisition and storage of threat-based memories and the modulation of the consolidation of arousing explicit memories, that is, the memories that are encoded and stored by the medial temporal lobe. In addition, in conjunction with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the BLA plays an important role in fear memory extinction. The BLA develops relatively early in life, but little is known about the molecular changes that accompany its development. Here, we quantified relative basal expression levels of sets of plasticity, synaptic, glia, and connectivity proteins in the rat BLA at various developmental ages: postnatal day 17 (PN17, infants), PN24 (juveniles), and PN80 (young adults). We found that the levels of activation markers of brain plasticity, including phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133, CamKII{$\alpha$} at Thr286, pERK1/pERK2 at Thr202/Tyr204, and GluA1 at Ser831 and Ser845, were significantly higher in infant and juvenile compared with adult brain. In contrast, age increase was accompanied by a significant augmentation in the levels of proteins that mark synaptogenesis and synapse maturation, such as synaptophysin, PSD95, SynCAM, GAD65, GAD67, and GluN2A/GluN2B ratio. Finally, we observed significant age-associated changes in structural markers, including MAP2, MBP, and MAG, suggesting that the structural connectivity of the BLA increases over time. The biological differences in the BLA between developmental ages compared with adulthood suggest the need for caution in extrapolating conclusions based on BLA-related brain plasticity and behavioral studies conducted at different developmental stages.},

Here we show that episodic learning produces unique biological changes in the hippocampus of infant rats and mice compared to juveniles and adults. These changes include persistent neuronal activation, BDNF-dependent increase in the excitatory synapse markers synaptophysin and PSD-95, and significant maturation of AMPA receptor synaptic responses. Inhibition of PSD-95 induction following learning impairs both AMPA receptor response maturation and infantile memory, indicating that the synapse formation/maturation is necessary for creating infantile memories. Conversely, capturing the learning-induced changes by presenting a subsequent learning experience or by chemogenetic activation of the neural ensembles tagged by learning matures memory functional competence. This memory competence is selective for the type of experience encountered, as it transfers within similar hippocampus-dependent learning domains but not to other hippocampus-dependent types of learning. Thus, experiences in early life produce selective maturation of memory abilities.},

Here, we assessed the metabolomic profile of the rat hippocampus at different developmental ages both at baseline and following episodic learning. We report that the hippocampal metabolome significantly changes over developmental ages and that learning regulates differential arrays of metabolites according to age. The infant hippocampus had the largest number of significant changes following learning, with downregulation of 54 metabolites. Of those, a large proportion was associated with the glutathione-mediated cellular defenses against oxidative stress. Further biochemical, molecular, and behavioral assessments revealed that infantile learning evokes a rapid and persistent increase in the activity of neuronal glutathione reductase, the enzyme that regenerates reduced glutathione from its oxidized form. Inhibition of glutathione reductase selectively impaired long-term memory formation in infant but not in juvenile and adult rats, confirming its age-specific role. Thus, metabolomic profiling revealed that the hippocampal glutathione-mediated antioxidant pathway is differentially required for the formation of infantile memory.},

The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) controls emotional and motivated behaviors in response to environmental cues and is hypothesized to do so in part by deciphering the positive or negative quality of these cues. Yet, what features of the environment are represented in the activity patterns of ventral CA1 (vCA1) neurons and whether the positive or negative meaning of stimuli is present at this stage remain unclear. Here, using two-photon calcium imaging across six experimental paradigms, we examined which features of salient stimuli are represented by vCA1 ensembles and found that identity, sensory features, and intensity---but not valence---are robustly encoded. These results offer a reappraisal of the vCA1 function, wherein information corresponding to individual stimulus features, and not their meaning, predominates. This organizational scheme may support flexible updating of stimulus value as internal states and environmental demands change.},

In both rats and mice, infantile memories, although not expressed, are actually stored long term in a latent form. These latent memories can be reinstated later in life by certain behavioral reminders or by artificial reactivations of neuronal ensembles activated at training. Whether the recovery of infantile memories is limited by developmental age, maternal presence, or contingency of stimuli presentation remains to be determined. Here, we show that the return of inhibitory avoidance memory in rats following a behavioral reactivation consisting of an exposure to the context (conditioned stimuli [CS]) and footshock (unconditioned stimuli [US]) given in a temporally unpaired fashion, is evident immediately after US and is limited by the developmental age at which the reactivations are presented; however, it is not influenced by maternal presence or the time interval between training and reactivation. We conclude that one limiting factor for infantile memory reinstatement is developmental age, suggesting that a brain maturation process is necessary to allow the recovery of a ``lost'' infantile memory.},

We found that the temporal progression of neurogenesis shapes maturation competence in ganglionic eminence progenitors, influencing how their progeny progress toward mature states. By contrast, differentiation competence---defined as the ability of progenitors to produce diverse transcriptomic identities---was maintained throughout neurogenesis. Chromatin remodeling, together with a regulatory module composed of the transcription factor NFIB and its target genes, influenced maturation competence in late-born neurons. These findings reveal how transcriptional programs and chromatin accessibility govern neuronal maturation and the diversification of GABAergic neuron subtypes during neurodevelopment.},

Finally, in contrast to the persisting view of the mind as a highly plastic blank slate ready for the world to make its imprint, we hypothesize that neuronal networks are endowed with a reservoir of neural trajectories, and the challenge faced by the brain is how to select and match preexisting neuronal trajectories with events in the world.},

Regulation and protection of metabolic and energetic processes require time-evolving brain computations enabling the organism to prepare for altered future states. Exaptation of such circuits was likely exploited for exploration of the organism's niche. We illustrate that exploration gives rise to a cognitive map, and in turn, environment-disengaged computation allows for mental travel into the past (memory) and the future (planning). Such brain-body interactions not only occur during waking but also persist during sleep. These exaptation steps are illustrated by the dual, endocrine-homeostatic and memory, contributions of the hippocampal system, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples.},

  abstract = {Individuals with an inherited deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) have impaired sexual reproduction. Previous genetic linkage studies and sequencing of plausible gene candidates have identified mutations associated with inherited GnRH deficiency, but the small number of affected families and limited success in validating candidates have impeded genetic diagnoses for most patients. Using a combination of exome sequencing and computational modeling, we have identified a shared point mutation in semaphorin 3E (SEMA3E) in 2 brothers with Kallmann syndrome (KS), which causes inherited GnRH deficiency. Recombinant wild-type SEMA3E protected maturing GnRH neurons from cell death by triggering a plexin D1--dependent (PLXND1-dependent) activation of PI3K-mediated survival signaling. In contrast, recombinant SEMA3E carrying the KS-associated mutation did not protect GnRH neurons from death. In murine models, lack of either SEMA3E or PLXND1 increased apoptosis of GnRH neurons in the developing brain, reducing innervation of the adult median eminence by GnRH-positive neurites. GnRH neuron deficiency in male mice was accompanied by impaired testes growth, a characteristic feature of KS. Together, these results identify SEMA3E as an essential gene for GnRH neuron development, uncover a neurotrophic function for SEMA3E in the developing brain, and elucidate SEMA3E/PLXND1/PI3K signaling as a mechanism that prevents GnRH neuron deficiency.},

Stronger extrinsic excitatory inputs characterized the contracted pupil substate, whereas higher recruitment of local inhibition was prominent during dilated pupil substates.

Next, we talk about recent advances in the inference of geometric and topological features of a density function using KDE. Finally, we illustrate how one can use KDE to estimate a cumulative distribution function and a receiver operating characteristic curve.

  abstract = {Moran's index is an important spatial statistical measure used to determine the presence or absence of spatial autocorrelation, thereby determining the selection orientation of spatial statistical methods. However, Moran's index is chiefly a statistical measurement rather than a mathematical model. This paper is devoted to establishing spatial autocorrelation models by means of linear regression analysis. Using standardized vector as independent variable, and spatial weighted vector as dependent variable, we can obtain a set of normalized linear autocorrelation equations based on quadratic form and vector inner product. The inherent structure of the models' parameters are revealed by mathematical derivation. The slope of the equation gives Moran's index, while the intercept indicates the average value of standardized spatial weight variable. The square of the intercept is negatively correlated with the square of Moran's index, but omitting the intercept does not affect the estimation of the slope value. The datasets of a real urban system are taken as an example to verify the reasoning results. A conclusion can be reached that the inner product equation of spatial autocorrelation based on Moran's index is effective. The models extend the function of spatial analysis, and help to understand the boundary values of Moran's index.},

We applied Stereo-seq to generate the mouse organogenesis spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas (MOSTA), which maps with single-cell resolution and high sensitivity the kinetics and directionality of transcriptional variation during mouse organogenesis. We used this information to gain insight into the molecular basis of spatial cell heterogeneity and cell fate specification in developing tissues such as the dorsal midbrain. Our panoramic atlas will facilitate in-depth investigation of longstanding questions concerning normal and abnormal mammalian development.},

  abstract = {Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is characterized by the absence of pubertal development and subsequent impaired fertility often due to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficits. Exome sequencing of two independent cohorts of IHH patients identified 12 rare missense variants in POU6F2 in 15 patients. POU6F2 encodes two distinct isoforms. In the adult mouse, expression of both isoform1 and isoform2 was detected in the brain, pituitary, and gonads. However, only isoform1 was detected in mouse primary GnRH cells and three immortalized GnRH cell lines, two mouse and one human. To date, the function of isoform2 has been verified as a transcription factor, while the function of isoform1 has been unknown. In the present report, bioinformatics and cell assays on a human-derived GnRH cell line reveal a novel function for isoform1, demonstrating it can act as a transcriptional regulator, decreasing GNRH1 expression. In addition, the impact of the two most prevalent POU6F2 variants, identified in five IHH patients, that were located at/or close to the DNA-binding domain was examined. Notably, one of these mutations prevented the repression of GnRH transcripts by isoform1. Normally, GnRH transcription increases as GnRH cells mature as they near migrate into the brain. Augmentation earlier during development can disrupt normal GnRH cell migration, consistent with some POU6F2 variants contributing to the IHH pathogenesis.},

The mechanisms underlying changes in reproduction in Nhlh2-deficient mice (Nhlh2-/-) are unclear. Here we show that hypothalamic GnRH-1 content is reduced in adult Nhlh2-/- mice as is the number of GnRH-1 neurons localized to mid- and caudal hypothalamic regions. This reduction was detected postnatally after normal migration of GnRH-1 neurons within nasal regions had occurred. Phenotype rescue experiments showed that female Nhlh2-/- mice were responsive to estrogen treatment. In contrast, puberty could not be primed in female Nhlh2-/- mice with a GnRH-1 regimen. The adenohypophysis of Nhlh2-/- mice was hypoplastic although it contained a full complement of the five anterior pituitary cell types. GnRH-1 receptors (GnRHRs) were reduced in Nhlh2-/- pituitary gonadotropes as compared with wild type. In vitro assays indicated that Nhlh2 expression is regulated in parallel with GnRHR expression. However, direct transcriptional activity of Nhlh2 on the GnRHR promoter was not found. These results indicate that Nhlh2 plays a role in the development and functional maintenance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis at least at two levels: 1) in the hypothalamus by regulating the number and distribution of GnRH-1 neurons and, 2) in the developing and mature adenohypophysis.},

  abstract = {Angelman syndrome (AS), a genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system, is characterized by delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and problems with movement and balance (ataxia). Most affected children also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy). No existing therapies are capable of comprehensively treating the deficits in AS; hence, there is an urgent need to identify new treatments. Here we show that insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) and mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), ligands of two independent binding sites of the cation-independent M6P/IGF-2 receptor (CIM6P/IGF-2R), reverse most major deficits of AS modeled in mice. Subcutaneous injection of IGF-2 or M6P in mice modeling AS restored cognitive impairments as assessed by measurements of contextual and recognition memories, motor deficits assessed by rotarod and hindlimb clasping, and working memory/flexibility measured by Y-maze. IGF-2 also corrected deficits in marble burying and significantly attenuated acoustically induced seizures. An observational battery of tests confirmed that neither ligand changed basic functions including physical characteristics, general behavioral responses, and sensory reflexes, indicating that they are relatively safe. Our data provide strong preclinical evidence that targeting CIM6P/IGF-2R is a promising approach for developing novel therapeutics for AS.

Here we show that, compared to adult, the juvenile rat hippocampus has significantly higher mRNA levels of several glucose metabolism enzymes belonging to all glucose metabolism pathways, as well as higher levels of the monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 and the glucose transporters endothelial-GLUT1 and GLUT3 proteins. Furthermore, relative to adults, long-term episodic memory formation in juvenile animals requires significantly higher rates of aerobic glycolysis and astrocytic-neuronal lactate coupling in the hippocampus. Only juvenile but not adult long-term memory formation recruits GLUT3, neuronal 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/ fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) and more efficiently engages glucose in the hippocampus. Hence, compared to adult, the juvenile hippocampus distinctively regulates glucose metabolism pathways, and formation of long-term memory in juveniles involves differential neuronal glucose metabolism mechanisms.},

Typically, signaling of Reelin occurs via apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), and the cytoplasmic adapter protein disabled 1 (Dab1). However, non-canonical Reelin signaling has been reported, though no receptors have yet been identified. Cariboni et al. (2005) indicated Dab1-independent Reelin signaling impacts gonadotropin releasing hormone-1 (GnRH) neuronal migration. GnRH cells are essential for reproduction. Prenatal migration of GnRH neurons from the nasal placode to the forebrain, juxtaposed to olfactory axons and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), has been well documented, and it is clear that alterations in migration of these cells can cause delayed or absent puberty. This study was initiated to delineate the non-canonical Reelin signaling pathways used by GnRH neurons. Chronic treatment of nasal explants with CR-50, an antibody known to interfere with Reelin homopolymerization and Dab1 phosphorylation, decreased the distance GnRH neurons and OECs migrated. Normal migration of these two cell types was observed when Reelin was co-applied with CR-50. Immunocytochemistry was performed to determine if OECs might transduce Reelin signals via the canonical pathway, and subsequently indirectly altering GnRH neuronal migration. We show that in mouse: (1) both OECs and GnRH cells express ApoER2, VLDLR and Dab1, and (2) GnRH neurons and OECs show a normal distribution in the brain of two mutant reeler lines. These results indicate that the canonical Reelin pathway is present in GnRH neurons and OECs, but that Reelin is not essential for development of these two systems in vivo.},

Here we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to dissect the response to exercise (free-wheel running) in the neurogenic stem-cell niche of the hippocampal dentate gyrus in male APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice. Transcriptomic responses to exercise were distinct between wild-type and AD mice, and most prominent in immature neurons. Exercise restored the transcriptional profiles of a proportion of AD-dysregulated genes in a cell type-specific manner. We identified a neurovascular-associated astrocyte subpopulation, the abundance of which was reduced in AD, whereas its gene expression signature was induced with exercise. Exercise also enhanced the gene expression profile of disease-associated microglia. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were the cell type with the highest proportion of dysregulated genes recovered by exercise. Last, we validated our key findings in a human AD snRNA-seq dataset. Together, these data present a comprehensive resource for understanding the molecular mediators of neuroprotection by exercise in AD.},

In contrast, either metabolite is unable to rescue memory impairment produced by expression knockdown of MCT2, which is selectively expressed by neurons, indicating that a critical role of astrocytic lactate is to provide energy for neuronal responses required for long-term memory. These responses include learning-induced mRNA translation in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as expression of Arc/Arg3.1. Thus, astrocytic lactate acts as an energy substrate to fuel learning-induced de novo neuronal translation critical for long-term memory.},

  abstract = {Xist RNA initiates X inactivation as it spreads in cis across the chromosome. Here, we reveal a biophysical basis for its cis-limited diffusion. Xist RNA and HNRNPK together drive a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) that encapsulates the chromosome. HNRNPK droplets pull on Xist and internalize the RNA. Once internalized, Xist induces a further phase transition and ``softens'' the HNRNPK droplet. Xist alters the condensate's deformability, adhesiveness, and wetting properties in vitro. Other Xist-interacting proteins are internalized and entrapped within the droplet, resulting in a concentration of Xist and protein partners within the condensate. We attribute LLPS to HNRNPK's RGG and Xist's repeat B (RepB) motifs. Mutating these motifs causes Xist diffusion, disrupts polycomb recruitment, and precludes the required mixing of chromosomal compartments for Xist's migration. Thus, we hypothesize that phase transitions in HNRNPK condensates allow Xist to locally concentrate silencing factors and to spread through internal channels of the HNRNPKencapsulated chromosome.},

Emergence of these activity patterns and functions is believed to be developmentally regulated, but the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations remains unknown. We investigate the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology in immature mice. We reveal that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. The transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. We demonstrate a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation. We hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks.},

  abstract = {The formation of memories that contain information about the specific time and place of acquisition, which are commonly referred to as ``autobiographical'' or ``episodic'' memories, critically relies on the hippocampus and on a series of interconnected structures located in the medial temporal lobe of the mammalian brain. The observation that adults retain very few of these memories from the first years of their life has fueled a long-standing debate on whether infants can make the types of memories that in adults are processed by the hippocampus-dependent memory system, and whether the hippocampus is involved in learning and memory processes early in life. Recent evidence shows that, even at a time when its circuitry is not yet mature, the infant hippocampus is able to produce long-lasting memories. However, the ability to acquire and store such memories relies on molecular pathways and network-based activity dynamics different from the adult system, which mature with age. The mechanisms underlying the formation of hippocampus-dependent memories during infancy, and the role that experience exerts in promoting the maturation of the hippocampus-dependent memory system, remain to be understood. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the ontogeny and the biological correlates of hippocampus-dependent memories.},

The developmental age of each embryo was determined by means of the Theiler staging system. During stages 17 and 18, the olfactory axons grew through the mesenchyme toward the cerebral vesicle; they were accompanied by a group of electron-dense cells which were referred to as peripheral glial progenitor cells (GPCs) because they ensheathed the adjacent axons. In Theiler stage 19--21 embryos, the axons and the peripheral GPCs grew dorsocaudally along the external surface of the bulb primordium forming a presumptive ONL immediately superficial to its glia limitans. Through small breaks in this glia limitans, the axons, but not the peripheral GPCs, penetrated into the marginal zone of the bulb primordium. Even though by the first half of stage 21 there were only short stretches of glia limitans separating the presumptive ONL from the marginal zone, there was no intermingling of the perikarya between the two layers. A definitive ONL could be identified by the second half of Theiler stage 21, by which time the glia limitans of the bulb primordium had totally disappeared. However, up to Theiler stage 24 of development the only cells to be found in this definitive ONL were the peripheral GPCs. Although in Theiler stage 25 and 26 embryos there was an additional population of less-electron-dense GPCs within the definitive ONL, these cells were likely derived from the previous group of peripheral GPCs rather than from cells newly emigrated from the deeper layers of the developing bulb. This developmental data necessitated a reevaluation of the cell lineages of the two glial cell types that reside within the ONL of the adult olfactory bulb.},

Probable contributing factors to the challenges in therapeutic development include the complexity of the human brain and the high polygenicity of psychiatric disorders. Combining well-powered genome-wide and brain-wide genetics and transcriptomics analyses can deepen our understanding of the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Here, we leverage two landmark resources to infer the cell types involved in the etiology of schizophrenia, other psychiatric disorders and informative comparison of brain phenotypes. We found both cortical and subcortical neuronal associations for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression.

  abstract = {Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a persistent, and impairing pediatric-onset neurodevelopmental condition. Its high prevalence, and recurrent controversy over its widespread identification and treatment, drive strong interest in its etiology and mechanisms. Emerging evidence for a role for neuroinflammation in ADHD pathophysiology is of great interest. This evidence includes 1) the above-chance comorbidity of ADHD with inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, 2) initial studies indicating an association with ADHD and increased serum cytokines, 3) preliminary evidence from genetic studies demonstrating associations between polymorphisms in genes associated with inflammatory pathways and ADHD, 4) emerging evidence that early life exposure to environmental factors may increase risk for ADHD via an inflammatory mechanism, and 5) mechanistic evidence from animal models of maternal immune activation documenting behavioral and neural outcomes consistent with ADHD. Prenatal exposure to inflammation is associated with changes in offspring brain development including reductions in cortical gray matter volume and the volume of certain cortical areas --parallel to observations associated with ADHD. Alterations in neurotransmitter systems, including the dopaminergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic systems, are observed in ADHD populations. Animal models provide strong evidence that development and function of these neurotransmitters systems are sensitive to exposure to in utero inflammation. In summary, accumulating evidence from human studies and animal models, while still incomplete, support a potential role for neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Confirmation of this association and the underlying mechanisms have become valuable targets for research. If confirmed, such a picture may be important in opening new intervention routes.},

We previously found that OSN axonal projections occur sequentially, from the DM to the VL region of the OE. The differential timing of axonal projections is important for olfactory map formation because early-arriving OSN axons secrete guidance cues at the OB to help navigate late-arriving OSN axons. We hypothesized that the differential timing of axonal projections is regulated by the timing of OSN neurogenesis. To test this idea, we investigated spatiotemporal patterns of OSN neurogenesis during olfactory development.},

  abstract = {Cognitive function in healthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates to olfactory performance. Aging and disease progression both show marked olfactory deficits in humans and rodents. As a clear understanding of what causes olfactory deficits is still missing, research on this topic is paramount to diagnostics and early intervention therapy. A recent development of this research is focusing on GABAergic interneurons. Both aging and AD show a change in excitation/inhibition balance, indicating reduced inhibitory network functions. In the olfactory system, inhibition has an especially prominent role in processing information, as the olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay station of olfactory information in the brain, contains an unusually high number of inhibitory interneurons. This review summarizes the current knowledge on inhibitory interneurons at the level of the OB and the primary olfactory cortices to gain an overview of how these neurons might influence olfactory behavior. We also compare changes in interneuron composition in different olfactory brain areas between healthy aging and AD as the most common neurodegenerative disease. We find that pathophysiological changes in olfactory areas mirror findings from hippocampal and cortical regions that describe a marked cell loss for GABAergic interneurons in AD but not aging. Rather than differences in brain areas, differences in vulnerability were shown for different interneuron populations through all olfactory regions, with somatostatin-positive cells most strongly affected.},

Despite the ubiquity of such contextual reasoning in everyday choice, how the brain flexibly uses different valuation schemes across contexts remains unknown. We addressed this question by monitoring neural activity from the hippocampus (HPC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of two monkeys performing a state-dependent choice task. We found that HPC neurons encoded state information as it became available and then, at the time of choice, relayed this information to the OFC via theta synchronization. During choice, the OFC represented value in a state-dependent manner; many OFC neurons uniquely coded for value in only one state but not the other. This suggests a functional dissociation whereby the HPC encodes contextual information that is broadcast to the OFC via theta synchronization to select a state-appropriate value subcircuit, thereby allowing for contextual reasoning in value-based choice.},

Both loss- and gain-of-function analyses demonstrate that class I is a default fate of OSNs and that Bcl11b dictates a class II OR choice by suppressing the effect of the J-element, a class I-OR enhancer. We further demonstrate that OSN-specific genetic manipulations of Bcl11b bias the OR class choice, generating mice with ``class I-dominant'' and ``class II-dominant'' noses, which display contrasting innate olfactory behaviors to two distinct aversive odorants. Overall, these findings reveal a unique transcriptional mechanism mediating a binary switch for OR class choice that is crucial to both the anatomical and functional organization of the olfactory system.},

However, the currently available tools used to perform GSEA have a limited ability to analyze large datasets, which is particularly problematic for the analysis of single-cell data. To overcome this limitation, we developed a GSEA package in Python (GSEApy), which could efficiently analyze large single-cell datasets.We present a package (GSEApy) that performs GSEA in either the command line or Python environment. GSEApy uses a Rust implementation to enable it to calculate the same enrichment statistic as GSEA for a collection of pathways. The Rust implementation of GSEApy is 3-fold faster than the Numpy version of GSEApy (v0.10.8) and uses \&gt;4-fold less memory. GSEApy also provides an interface between Python and Enrichr web services, as well as for BioMart. The Enrichr application programming interface enables GSEApy to perform over-representation analysis for an input gene list. Furthermore, GSEApy consists of several tools, each designed to facilitate a particular type of enrichment analysis.The new GSEApy with Rust extension is deposited in PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/gseapy/. The GSEApy source code is freely available at https://github.com/zqfang/GSEApy. Also, the documentation website is available at https://gseapy.rtfd.io/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, recent studies have shown that disrupting Reelin function in the adult hippocampus induces repositioning of fully differentiated neurons, suggesting a stabilizing effect of Reelin on mature neuronal circuitry. Indeed, Reelin was recently found to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton by inducing cofilin phosphorylation. When unphosphorylated, cofilin acts as an actin-depolymerizing protein that promotes the disassembly of F-actin. Here, a novel hypothesis is proposed whereby decreased Reelin expression in the mature brain causes destabilization of neurons and their processes, leading to aberrant plasticity and aberrant wiring of brain circuitry. This has implications for brain disorders, such as epilepsy and schizophrenia, in which deficiencies in Reelin expression occur.}

  abstract = {Early olfactory axons follow a specific pathway to reach the developing telencephalon. We observed that a subpopulation of these axons, the pioneer olfactory axons, penetrate into the ventricular zone of a highly restricted region of the telencephalon at E13 and E14. At E15, this same telencephalic region evaginates to form the olfactory bulb. To investigate the possibility that the pioneer olfactory axons induce the olfactory bulb by influencing precursor cell populations, we compared cell cycle kinetics and differentiation in the olfactory bulb primordium and the adjacent neocortex using cumulative bromdeoxyurldine labeling. The results showed that, 24 hr after the arrival of the first pioneer axons, the duration of the cell cycle is prolonged significantly in the olfactory bulb primordium. In addition, twice as many cells have exited the mitotic cycle in the olfactory bulb primordium versus the adjacent cortex. These findings suggest that pioneer olfactory axons play a role in the induction of the olfactory bulb by selectively modulating cell cycle kinetics in the olfactory bulb primordium. Afferent axons may influence target morphogenesis by modulating target precursor cell proliferation in other developing neural structures.}

The protein family is constituted by other 4 members (besides STOML3): STOM, STOML1, STOML2 and podocin. Interestingly, STOML3 with STOM and STOML1 are expressed in other peripheral sensory neurons: dorsal root ganglia. In here, they functionally interact and modulate the activity of the mechanosensitive Piezo channels and members of the ASIC family. Therefore, we investigated whether STOM and STOML1 are expressed together with STOML3 in the OSNs and whether they could interact. We found that all three are indeed expressed in ONSs, although STOML1 at very low level. STOM and STOML3 share a similar expression pattern and STOML3 is necessary for STOM to properly localize to OSN cilia. In addition, we extended our investigation to podocin and STOML2, and while the former is not expressed in the olfactory system, the latter showed a peculiar expression pattern in multiple cell types. In summary, we provided a first complete description of stomatin-domain protein family in the olfactory system, highlighting the precise compartmentalization, possible interactions and, finally, their functional implications.},

Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons display one of the most striking forms of feature selectivity by forming spatially and contextually selective receptive fields called place fields, which serve as a model for studying the synaptic basis of learning and memory. Various forms of synaptic plasticity have been proposed as cellular substrates for the emergence of place fields. However, despite decades of work, our understanding of how synaptic plasticity underlies place-field formation and memory encoding remains limited, largely due to a shortage of tools and technical challenges associated with the visualization of synaptic plasticity at the single-neuron resolution in awake behaving animals. To~address this, we developed an all-optical approach to monitor the spatiotemporal tuning and synaptic weight changes of dendritic spines before and after the induction of a place field in single CA1 pyramidal neurons during spatial navigation. We identified a temporally asymmetric synaptic plasticity kernel resulting from bidirectional modifications of synaptic weights around the induction of a place field. Our work identified compartment-specific differences in the magnitude and temporal expression of synaptic plasticity between basal dendrites~and oblique dendrites. Our results provide experimental evidence linking synaptic plasticity to the rapid emergence of spatial selectivity in hippocampal neurons, a critical prerequisite for episodic memory.},

Composed of {$\alpha$}-synuclein, Lewy pathology is found both in dopaminergic neurons that modulate motor function, and cortical regions that control cognitive function. Recent work has established the molecular identity of dopaminergic neurons susceptible to death, but little is known about cortical neurons susceptible to Lewy pathology or molecular changes induced by aggregates. In the current study, we use spatial transcriptomics to capture whole transcriptome signatures from cortical neurons with {$\alpha$}-synuclein pathology compared to neurons without pathology. We find, both in PD and related PD dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and in the pre-formed fibril {$\alpha$}-synucleinopathy mouse model, that specific classes of excitatory neurons are vulnerable to developing Lewy pathology. Further, we identify conserved gene expression changes in aggregate-bearing neurons that we designate the Lewy-associated molecular dysfunction from aggregates (LAMDA) signature. Neurons with aggregates downregulate synaptic, mitochondrial, ubiquitin-proteasome, endo-lysosomal, and cytoskeletal genes and upregulate DNA repair and complement/cytokine genes. Our results identify neurons vulnerable to Lewy pathology in the PD cortex and describe a conserved signature of molecular dysfunction in both mice and humans.},

Suppression of Bcl11b by RNA interference selectively induced apoptosis in transformed T cells whereas normal mature T cells remained unaffected. The apoptosis was effected by simultaneous activation of death receptor-mediated and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, most likely as a result of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) upregulation and suppression of the Bcl-xL antiapoptotic protein.

Several genes are important for central hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in mammals, including many that are transcribed in both the brain and testis. However, the expression of these genes in prepubertal gonads has not been studied systematically, and little is known about the effect of hormone therapy on their testicular and neuronal expression levels. In this review, we interpret histological sections, data on hormone levels, and RNA profiling data from adult normal testes compared to pre-pubertal low infertility risk (LIR) and high infertility risk (HIR) patients randomly treated with surgery in combination with GnRHa or only surgery. We organize 31 target genes relevant for idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and cryptorchidism into five classes depending on their expression levels in HIR versus LIR samples and their response to GnRHa treatment. Nescient-helix-loop-helix 2 (NHLH2) was the only gene showing a decreased mRNA level in HIR patients and an increase after GnRHa treatment. This phenomenon may reflect a broader effect of hormone treatment on gene expression in both testicular and central nervous system tissues, which could explain why the hypothalamus-pituitary-testicular axis is permanently restored by the administration of GnRHa.},

  abstract = {Glioblastoma is an incurable brain malignancy. By the time of clinical diagnosis, these tumours exhibit a degree of genetic and cellular heterogeneity that provides few clues to the mechanisms that initiate and drive gliomagenesis1,2. Here, to explore the early steps in gliomagenesis, we utilized conditional gene deletion and lineage tracing in tumour mouse models, coupled with serial magnetic resonance imaging, to initiate and then closely track tumour formation. We isolated labelled and unlabelled cells at multiple stages---before the first visible abnormality, at the time of the first visible lesion, and then through the stages of tumour growth---and subjected cells of each stage to single-cell profiling. We identify a malignant cell state with a neural crest-like gene expression signature that is highly abundant in the early stages, but relatively diminished in the late stage of tumour growth. Genomic analysis based on the presence of copy number alterations suggests that these neural crest-like states exist as part of a heterogeneous clonal hierarchy that evolves with tumour growth. By exploring the injury response in wounded normal mouse brains, we identify cells with a similar signature that emerge following injury and then disappear over time, suggesting that activation of an injury response program occurs during tumorigenesis. Indeed, our experiments reveal a non-malignant injury-like microenvironment that is initiated in the brain following oncogene activation in cerebral precursor cells. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the early stages of glioblastoma, identifying a unique cell state and an injury response program tied to early tumour formation. These findings have implications for glioblastoma therapies and raise new possibilities for early diagnosis and prevention of disease.},

  abstract = {The cognitive processes supporting complex animal behavior are closely associated with movements responsible for critical processes, such as facial expressions or the active sampling of our environments. These movements are strongly related to neural activity across much of the brain and are often highly correlated with ongoing cognitive processes. A fundamental issue for understanding the neural signatures of cognition and movements is whether cognitive processes are separable from related movements or if they are driven by common neural mechanisms. Here we demonstrate how the separability of cognitive and motor processes can be assessed and, when separable, how the neural dynamics associated with each component can be isolated. We designed a behavioral task in mice that involves multiple cognitive processes, and we show that dynamics commonly taken to support cognitive processes are strongly contaminated by movements. When cognitive and motor components are isolated using a novel approach for subspace decomposition, we find that they exhibit distinct dynamical trajectories and are encoded by largely separate populations of cells. Accurately isolating dynamics associated with particular cognitive and motor processes will be essential for developing conceptual and computational models of neural circuit function.},

Several secreted signaling molecules are expressed at putative signaling centers in the early telencephalon. In particular, Fgf8 is expressed at the anterior end of the telencephalon and is hypothesized to pattern it along the anteroposterior (AP) axis. Using a CRE/loxP genetic approach to disrupt genes in the telencephalon, we address the role of FGF signaling directly in vivo by abolishing expression of the FGF receptor Fgfr1. In the Fgfr1-deficient telencephalon, AP patterning is largely normal. However, morphological defects are observed at the anterior end of the telencephalon. Most notably, the olfactory bulbs do not form normally. Examination of the proliferation state of anterior telencephalic cells supports a model for olfactory bulb formation in which an FGF-dependent decrease in proliferation is required for initial bulb evagination. Together the results demonstrate an essential role for Fgfr1 in patterning and morphogenesis of the telencephalon.},

A graph-based analysis assigns the subcellular localization of over 7,600 proteins, defines spatial networks, and uncovers interconnections between cellular compartments. Our approach can be deployed to comprehensively profile proteome remodeling during cellular perturbation. By characterizing the cellular landscape following HCoV-OC43 viral infection, we discover that many proteins are regulated by changes in their spatial distribution rather than by changes in abundance. Our results establish that proteome-wide analysis of subcellular remodeling provides key insights for elucidating cellular responses, uncovering an essential role for ferroptosis in OC43 infection.

We developed mouse lines that express either Cre recombinase (Cre) for constitutive targeting, or destabilized-domain Cre recombinase (DD-Cre) for inducible targeting from the Cst7 locus (Cst7DD-Cre) to specifically manipulate disease associated microglia (DAM) and crossed with Ai14 tdTomato cre-reporter line mice. Cst7Cre was found to target all brain resident myeloid cells, due to transient developmental expression of Cst7, but no expression was found in the inducible Cst7DD-Cre mice. Further crossing of this line with 5xFAD mice combined with dietary administration of trimethoprim to induce DD-Cre activity produces long-term labeling in DAM without evidence of leakiness, with tdTomato-expression restricted to cells surrounding plaques. Using this model, we found that DAMs are a subset of plaqueassociated microglia (PAMs) and their transition to DAM increases with age and disease stage. Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed that tdTomato+ cells show higher expression of disease and inflammatory genes compared to other microglial populations, including non-labeled PAMs. These models allow either complete cre-loxP targeting of all brain myeloid cells (Cst7Cre), or inducible targeting of DAMs, without leakiness (Cst7DD-Cre).},

Olfactory nerve axons reach the presumptive olfactory bulb at E12 and many penetrate deeply into the intermediate (mantle) layer at this time. The first identified young neurons (postmitotic neuroblasts) were also seen at E12. Many had a tangential orientation, and they occurred only in the region where olfactory nerve axons were present. Olfactory nerve axons (and also mitral cell axons formed later) are characterized by numerous longitudinallyoriented microtubules and an extensive system of transversely and longitudinallyorinted cisternae of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). Near the growing tips of olfactory nerve axons, the microtubules disappear and the SER becomes more extensive and irregular. The four stages of early mitral cell differentiation determined in the companion paper (Hinds, '72) were confirmed by electron microscopic analysis. In the earliest cells of the primitive radial stage few organelles occur in the perikaryon, but in later cells of this stage and in cells of the pre-axonic tangential stage a Golgi complex and a pair of centrioles occurs on one side of the nucleus at the base of the largest tangential process, thus determining a cell polarity within the tangential plane. This initial polarity at E12 seems to be random and unrelated to the polarity attained when axon outgrowth occurs at E13 and E14, suggesting a re-orientation prior to axon outgrowth. The growing tips of primitive tangential processes were studied and compared with those of growing primitive radial processes and growing axons.},

Taking advantage of the parallel coding lines present in the olfactory system, we explored the potential variations of neuronal identities before and after olfactory experience. We found that at rest, the transcriptomic profiles of mouse olfactory sensory neuron populations are already divergent, specific to the olfactory receptor they express, and are associated with the sequence of these latter. These divergent profiles further evolve in response to the environment, as odorant exposure leads to reprogramming via the modulation of transcription. These findings highlight a broad range of sensory neuron identities that are present at rest and that adapt to the experience of the individual, thus adding to the complexity and flexibility of sensory coding.},

  abstract = {4505 The B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 11B (BCL11B) gene plays a crucial role in T-cell development, differentiation, and proliferation. BCL11B disturbed expression, mutation, disruption, or rearrangement has been associated with T-cell malignancies. Here, we described the effects of BCL11B target-specific small interfering RNA (BCL11B-siRNA) on the proliferation, apoptosis, and global gene expression profiling of Molt-4 cells. The BCL11B-siRNA beginning with the 924bp of mRNA sequence, and the scrambled non-silencing siRNA control (sc) were obtained by chemosynthesis. Non-treated, mock-transfected, and sc-treated cells were used as controls. BCL11B expression in mRNA levels were analyzed at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after siRNA delivered by nucleofection using the real-time quantitative PCR with Taqman technique. At the same time points, cell proliferations were assayed by the cell count kit-8 method. The morphology and the percentage of apoptosis were revealed by Hoechst33258 stain and flow cytometry at 72 h, respectively. An obvious reduction in mRNA level was observed in BCL11B-siRNA treated cells at 24 h, compared to the controls (P{$<$} 0.05). The proliferation rates of BCL11B--siRNA treated cells were significantly decreased from 24 h to 72 h (P{$<$} 0.05). BCL11B--siRNA treated cells showed a large increase in PI-positive cells, reaching to 84.6\%. However, the percentage of each cell phases did not reveal significantly difference. Thus, the apoptosis could be induced in all phases of the cell cycle. The Hoechst33258 stain was used to verify the apoptosis. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms accounting for BCL11B-siRNA-mediated cell death, global gene expression profiling were performed on the BCL11B--siRNA treated cells and non-treated control by the Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip at 24 h after nucleofection. The BCL11B showed 10.1 fold reductions in mRNA levels. Upregulated genes was found in 1982 probe sets, while 1884 genes down-regulated, at least two folds upon Bcl11b suppression. Involvement of the T-cell activation or differentiation as TRAT1, CD3G, CD247, LCK, PTGER4, or CD1D, all revealed at least 7 folds down-regulated, which may contribute to the inhibition of proliferation. Six genes of the TNF receptor family were up-regulated at least 2 folds as well as the BCL-2 gene down-regulated 3.5 folds. The apoptosis was most likely affected by the simultaneous activation of TNF receptor family genes and suppression of the Bcl-2 gene. Those related to the autophagy and the cell cycle did not find significant change. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the survival of Molt-4 cells was critically dependent on BCL11B gene. Suppression of BCL11B by RNA interference selectively inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis effectively in transformed Molt-4 cells. Therefore, down-regulation of Bcl11b might be considered as a new target therapeutic strategy in T-cell malignancies.

Disruption of FGF signaling contributes to Kallmann syndrome characterized by both anosmia and sexual immaturity. However, several unanswered questions remain as to which specific FGF receptor (FGFR)-1 signaling pathways are necessary for OB and GnRH neuronal development. Here, using pharmacological phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) isoform-specific inhibitors, we demonstrate a central role for the PI3K p110{$\alpha$} isoform as a downstream effector of FGFR1 signaling for both GnRH neuronal migration and OB development. We show that signaling via the PI3K p110{$\alpha$} isoform is required for GnRH neuronal migration in explant cultures of embryonic day (E) 4 chick olfactory placodes. We also show that in ovo administration of LY294002, a global PI3K inhibitor as well as an inhibitor to the PI3K p110{$\alpha$} isoform into the olfactory placode of E3 chick embryo impairs GnRH neuronal migration toward the forebrain. In contrast, in ovo PI3K inhibitor treatment produced no obvious defects on primary olfactory sensory neuron axonal targeting and bundle formation. We also demonstrate that anosmin-1 and FGF2 induced neuronal migration of immortalized human embryonic GnRH neuroblast cells (FNC-B4-hTERT) is mediated by modulating FGFR1 signaling via the PI3K p110{$\alpha$} isoform, specifically through phosphorylation of the PI3K downstream effectors, Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3{$\beta$}. Finally, we show that neurite outgrowth and elongation of OB neurons in E10 chick OB explants are also dependent on the PI3K p110{$\alpha$} isoform downstream of FGFR1.

  abstract = {The ability to observe the social behavior of others and use observed information to bias future action is a fundamental building block of social cognition1,2. A foundational question is whether social observation and experience engage common circuit mechanisms that enable behavioral change. While classic studies on social learning have shown that aggressive behaviors can be learned through observation3, it remains unclear whether aggression observation promotes persistent neural changes that generalize to new contexts. Here, to directly compare the effects of aggression experience and observation at brain-wide scale, we develop a strategy to perform large-scale cell-type specific recordings across subcortical networks for social behavior control and learning. We record longitudinally while animals ``train'' through direct experience or observation, then probe shared differences in behavior and neural activity in a novel ``hard'' aggression context. Using supervised and unsupervised methods for behavioral quantification, we detect unique signatures of a shared behavioral strategy not present in animals with no training. During observation, we find widespread activation that mimics experience in networks for behavior generation, with critical differences in signals associated with reward and threat learning. After observation, we observe that changes persist into the novel aggression context, with increased similarity in the neural dynamics between experience and observation groups. Network-level modeling reveals persistent shared changes to a core aggression network, with widespread decoupling of inhibition from a key hypothalamic output region. This demonstrates that ``experience-like'' activity during observation can recruit a shared plasticity mechanism that biases behavior toward adaptive defensive strategies in new contexts.},

  abstract = {Accurate goal-directed behaviour requires the sense of touch to be integrated with information about body position and ongoing motion1,2. Behaviours such as chewing, swallowing and speech critically depend on precise tactile events on a rapidly moving tongue3, but neural circuits for dynamic touch-guided tongue control are unknown. Here, using high-speed videography, we examined three-dimensional lingual kinematics as mice drank from a water spout that unexpectedly changed position during licking, requiring re-aiming in response to subtle contact events on the left, centre or right surface of the tongue. Mice integrated information about both precise touch events and tongue position to re-aim ensuing licks. Touch-guided re-aiming was unaffected by photoinactivation of tongue sensory, premotor and motor cortices, but was impaired by photoinactivation of the lateral superior colliculus (latSC). Electrophysiological recordings identified latSC neurons with mechanosensory receptive fields for precise touch events that were anchored in tongue-centred, head-centred or conjunctive reference frames. Notably, latSC neurons also encoded tongue position before contact, information that is important for tongue-to-head-based coordinate transformations underlying accurate touch-guided aiming. Viral tracing revealed tongue sensory inputs to the latSC from the lingual trigeminal nucleus, and optical microstimulation in the latSC revealed a topographic map for aiming licks. These findings demonstrate that touch-guided tongue control relies on a collicular mechanosensorimotor map, analogous to collicular visuomotor maps associated with visually guided orienting across many species.},

However, even in energy-intensive brains, numerous parsimonious processes operate to optimize energy use. We review how this balance manifests in both homeostatic processes and task-associated cognition. We also consider the perturbations and disruptions of metabolism in neurocognitive diseases.},

  abstract = {The hypothalamus coordinately regulates physiological homeostasis and innate behaviors, yet the detailed arrangement of hypothalamic axons remains unclear. Here we mapped the whole-brain projections of over 7,000 hypothalamic neurons expressing distinct neuropeptides in male mice, identifying 2 main classes and 31 types using single-neuron projectome analysis. These classes/types exhibited regionally biased soma distribution and specific neuropeptide enrichment. Notably, many projectome types extended long-range axon collaterals to distinct brain regions, allowing single axons to co-regulate multiple targets. We uncovered topographic organization of certain peptidergic axons at specific targets, along with diverse single-neuron projectome patterns in Orexin, Agrp and Pomc populations. Furthermore, hypothalamic peptidergic neurons showed correlated innervation of subdomains in the periaqueductal gray and organized into modular subnetworks within the hypothalamus, providing a structural basis for coordinated outputs. This dataset highlights the complexity of hypothalamic axonal projections and lays a foundation for future investigation of the circuit mechanisms underlying hypothalamic functions.},

  abstract = {Biological ageing can be defined as a gradual loss of homeostasis across various aspects of molecular and cellular function1,2. Mammalian brains consist of thousands of cell types3, which may be differentially susceptible or resilient to ageing. Here we present a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing dataset containing roughly 1.2\,million high-quality single-cell transcriptomes of brain cells from young adult and aged mice of both sexes, from regions spanning the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. High-resolution clustering of all cells results in 847 cell clusters and reveals at least 14 age-biased clusters that are mostly glial types. At the broader cell subclass and supertype levels, we find age-associated gene expression signatures and provide a list of 2,449 unique differentially expressed genes (age-DE genes) for many neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. Whereas most age-DE genes are unique to specific cell types, we observe common signatures with ageing across cell types, including a decrease in expression of genes related to neuronal structure and function in many neuron types, major astrocyte types and mature oligodendrocytes, and an increase in expression of genes related to immune function, antigen presentation, inflammation, and cell motility in immune cell types and some vascular cell types. Finally, we observe that some of the cell types that demonstrate the greatest sensitivity to ageing are concentrated around the third ventricle in the hypothalamus, including tanycytes, ependymal cells, and certain neuron types in the arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and paraventricular nucleus that express genes canonically related to energy homeostasis. Many of these types demonstrate both a decrease in neuronal function and an increase in immune response. These findings suggest that the third ventricle in the hypothalamus may be a hub for ageing in the mouse brain. Overall, this study systematically delineates a dynamic landscape of cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in the brain associated with normal ageing that will serve as a foundation for the investigation of functional changes in ageing and the interaction of ageing and disease.},

For episodic types of memories, two regions undergoing this transcription are the dorsal hippocampus (dHC) and prelimbic (PL) cortex. Whether and to what extent these regions regulate similar or distinct transcriptomic profiles upon learning remain to be understood. Here, we used RNA sequencing in the dHC and PL cortex of male rats to profile their transcriptomes in untrained conditions (baseline) and at 1 h and 6 d after inhibitory avoidance learning. We found that, of 33,713 transcripts, {$>$}14,000 were significantly expressed at baseline in both regions and {$\sim$}3000 were selectively enriched in each region. Gene Ontology biological pathway analyses indicated that commonly expressed pathways included synapse organization, regulation of membrane potential, and vesicle localization. The enriched pathways in the dHC were gliogenesis, axon development, and lipid modification, while in the PL cortex included vesicle localization and synaptic vesicle cycle. At 1 h after learning, 135 transcripts changed significantly in the dHC and 478 in the PL cortex; of these, only 34 were shared. Biological pathways most significantly regulated by learning in the dHC were protein dephosphorylation, glycogen and glucan metabolism, while in the PL cortex were axon development and axonogenesis. The transcriptome profiles returned to baseline by 6 d after training. Thus, a significant portion of dHC and PL cortex transcriptomic profiles is divergent, and their regulation upon learning is largely distinct and transient.                            SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               Long-term episodic memory formation requires gene transcription in several brain regions, including the hippocampus and PFC. The comprehensive profiles of the dynamic mRNA changes that occur in these regions following learning are not well understood. Here, we performed RNA sequencing in the dorsal hippocampus and prelimbic cortex, a PFC subregion, at baseline, 1 h, and 6 d after episodic learning in rats. We found that, at baseline, dorsal hippocampus and prelimbic cortex differentially express a significant portion of mRNAs. Moreover, learning produces a transient regulation of region-specific profiles of mRNA, indicating that unique biological programs in different brain regions underlie memory formation.},

However, the embryonic development of OE and OB by using the olfactory specific genes has not been comprehensively investigated yet. Most previous studies were limited to a specific embryonic stage, and very little is known, till date, about the development of OE. Methods The current study aimed to explore the development of mouse olfactory system by spatiotemporal analysis of the histological features by using the olfactory specific genes of olfactory system from the prenatal to postnatal period. Results We found that OE is divided into endo-turbinate, ecto-turbinate, and vomeronasal organs, and that putative OB with putative main and accessory OB is formed in the early developmental stage. The OE and OB became multilayered in the later developmental stages, accompanied by the differentiation of olfactory neurons. Remarkably, we found the development of layers of olfactory cilia and differentiation of OE to progress dramatically after birth, suggesting that the exposure to air may facilitate the final development of OE. Discussion Overall, the present study laid the groundwork for a better understanding of the spatial and temporal developmental events of the olfactory system.},

  abstract = {The cerebellum is activated by noxious stimuli and pathological pain but its role in noxious information processing remains unknown. Here, we show that in mice, cutaneous noxious electrical stimuli induced noradrenaline (NA) release from locus coeruleus (LC) terminals in the cerebellar cortex. Bergmann glia (BG) accumulated these LC--NA signals by increasing intracellular calcium in an integrative manner (`flares'). BG flares were also elicited in response to an intraplantar capsaicin injection. Chemogenetic inactivation of LC terminals or BG in the cerebellar cortex or BG-specific knockdown of {$\alpha$}1-adrenergic receptors suppressed BG flares, reduced nocifensive licking and had analgesic effects in nerve injury-induced chronic neuropathic pain. Moreover, chemogenetic activation of BG or an intraplantar capsaicin injection reduced Purkinje cell firing, which may disinhibit the output activity of the deep cerebellar nuclei. These results suggest a role for BG in computing noxious information from the LC and in modulating pain-related behaviors by regulating cerebellar output.},

Odor detection starts with the activation of odorant receptors (ORs), expressed in mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) populating the olfactory mucosa. Different odorants, or different concentrations of the same odorant, activate unique ensembles of ORs. This mechanism of combinatorial receptor coding provided a possible explanation as to why different odorants are perceived as having distinct odors. Aided by new technologies, several recent studies have found that antagonist interactions also play an important role in the formation of the combinatorial receptor code. These findings mark the start of a new era in the study of odorant-receptor interactions and add a new level of complexity to odor coding in mammals.},

We report that the transcription factor SOX5 controls the sequential generation of distinct corticofugal neuron subtypes by preventing premature emergence of normally later-born corticofugal neurons. SOX5 loss-of-function causes striking overlap of the identities of the three principal sequentially born corticofugal neuron subtypes: subplate neurons, corticothalamic neurons, and subcerebral projection neurons. In Sox5-/- cortex, subplate neurons aberrantly develop molecular hallmarks and connectivity of subcerebral projection neurons; corticothalamic neurons are imprecisely differentiated, while differentiation of subcerebral projection neurons is accelerated. Gain-of-function analysis reinforces the critical role of SOX5 in controlling the sequential generation of corticofugal neurons---SOX5 overexpression at late stages of corticogenesis causes re-emergence of neurons with corticofugal features. These data indicate that SOX5 controls the timing of critical fate decisions during corticofugal neuron production and thus subtype-specific differentiation and neocortical neuron diversity.},

The current study was aimed to determine whether EPO also provides long-lasting neuroprotection against HI in P5 rats, which is relevant to immature human infants. Sprague-Dawley rats at P5 were subjected to right common carotid artery ligation followed by an exposure to 6\% oxygen with balanced nitrogen for 1.5 h. Human recombinant EPO (rEPO, at a dose of 5 units/g) was administered intraperitoneally one hour before or immediately after insult, followed by additional injections at 24 and 48 h post-insult. The control rats were injected with normal saline following HI. Neurobehavioral tests were performed on P8 and P20, and brain injury was examined on P21. HI insult significantly impaired neurobehavioral performance including sensorimotor, locomotor activity and cognitive ability on the P8 and P20 rats. HI insult also resulted in brain inflammation (as indicated by microglia activation) and neuronal death (as indicated by Jade B positive staining) in the white matter, striatum, cortex, and hippocampal areas of the P21 rat. Both pre- and post-treatment with rEPO significantly improved neurobehavioral performance and protected against the HI-induced neuronal death, microglia activation (OX42+) as well as loss of mature oligodendrocytes (APC-CC1+) and hippocampal neurons (Nissl+). The long-lasting protective effects of rEPO in the neonatal rat HI model suggest that to exert neurotrophic activity in the brain might be an effective approach for therapeutic treatment of neonatal brain injury induced by hypoxia-ischemia.},

While categorical perception is thought to arise in the neocortex, humans and animals could benefit from a functional organization tailored to ethologically relevant sound processing earlier in the auditory pathway. Here we developed two-photon calcium imaging in the awake echolocating bat (Eptesicus fuscus) to study the representation of vocalizations in the inferior colliculus, which is as few as two synapses from the inner ear. Echolocating bats rely on frequency-sweep-based vocalizations for social communication and navigation. Auditory playback experiments demonstrated that individual neurons responded selectively to social or navigation calls, enabling robust population-level decoding across categories. When social calls were morphed into navigation calls in equidistant step-wise increments, individual neurons showed switch-like properties and population-level response patterns sharply transitioned at the category boundary. Strikingly, category-selective neurons formed spatial clusters, independent of tonotopy within the dorsal cortex of the inferior colliculus. These findings support a revised view of categorical processing in which specified channels for ethologically relevant sounds are spatially segregated early in the auditory hierarchy, enabling rapid subcortical organization into categorical primitives.},

  abstract = {The statistic known as Moran's I is widely used to test for the presence of spatial dependence in observations taken on a lattice. Under the null hypothesis that the data are independent and identically distributed normal random variates, the distribution of Moran's I is known, and hypothesis tests based on this statistic have been shown in the literature to have various optimality properties. Given its simplicity, Moran's I is also frequently used outside of the formal hypothesis-testing setting in exploratory analyses of spatially referenced data; however, its limitations are not very well understood. To illustrate these limitations, we show that, for data generated according to the spatial autoregressive (SAR) model, Moran's I is only a good estimator of the SAR model's spatial-dependence parameter when the parameter is close to 0. In this research, we develop an alternative closed-form measure of spatial autocorrelation, which we call APLE, because it is an approximate profile-likelihood estimator (APLE) of the SAR model's spatial-dependence parameter. We show that APLE can be used as a test statistic for, and an estimator of, the strength of spatial autocorrelation. We include both theoretical and simulation-based motivations (including comparison with the maximum-likelihood estimator), for using APLE as an estimator. In conjunction, we propose the APLE scatterplot, an exploratory graphical tool that is analogous to the Moran scatterplot, and we demonstrate that the APLE scatterplot is a better visual tool for assessing the strength of spatial autocorrelation in the data than the Moran scatterplot. In addition, Monte Carlo tests based on both APLE and Moran's I are introduced and compared. Finally, we include an analysis of the well-known Mercer and Hall wheat-yield data to illustrate the difference between APLE and Moran's I when they are used in exploratory spatial data analysis.},

Olfactory bulbectomy, an established model of depression that reduces limbic gamma oscillations, suffers from non-specific effects of structural damage. Here, we show that transient functional suppression of olfactory bulb neurons or their piriform cortex efferents decreased gamma oscillation power in limbic areas and induced depression-like behaviors in rodents. Enhancing transmission of gamma oscillations from olfactory bulb to limbic structures by closed-loop electrical neuromodulation alleviated these behaviors. By contrast, silencing gamma transmission by anti-phase closed-loop stimulation strengthened depression-like behaviors in naive animals. These induced behaviors were neutralized by ketamine treatment that restored limbic gamma power. Taken together, our results reveal a causal link between limbic gamma oscillations and depression-like behaviors in rodents. Interfering with these endogenous rhythms can affect behaviors in rodent models of depression, suggesting that restoring gamma oscillations may alleviate depressive symptoms.},

Sodium para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS-Na) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that can cross the blood-brain barrier. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of juvenile rat Pb exposure on behavioral changes and brain inflammation, and the efficacy of PAS-Na in ameliorating these effects. The results showed that Pb exposure during the juvenile period (from weaning to adult period) delayed rats' growth development and impaired their motor learning. Pb exposure not only increased Pb concentrations in several brain regions (including hippocampus, striatum and substantia nigra), but also disrupted metal-homeostasis in the brain, as higher levels of iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca) were observed in the substantia nigra. Moreover, Pb activated the MAPK pathway and increased levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1{$\beta$}, TNF-{$\alpha$} and IL-6 in the hippocampus, striatum and substantia nigra. Furthermore, Pb increased the levels of alpha-synuclein ({$\alpha$}-syn) in these brain sites. PAS-Na improved the motor deficits and brain inflammation in the Pb-exposed rats. Moreover, the elevated Pb, Fe and Ca concentrations in the brain were significantly reduced by PAS-Na, which contains amino, carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups, suggesting that it may act as a chelator of brain metals. In addition, PAS-Na inhibited the Pb-induced MAPK pathway activation and {$\alpha$}-syn accumulation in the same brain regions. Taken together, our novel study suggest that PASNa shows efficacy in improving the Pb-induced behavioral changes in rats by inhibiting MAPK-dependent inflammatory pathways and reducing {$\alpha$}-syn accumulation.},

In contrast, CLOCK knockout in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons showed reduced complexity of dendrites and lower density of presynaptic puncta.

This is because regulatory DNA elements make selective and stable contacts with DNA sequences located megabases away, instead of interacting with proximal sequences occupied by the same exact transcription factors (TF). This is exemplified in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), where only a fraction of Lhx2/Ebf1/Ldb1-bound sites interact with each other, converging into highly selective multi-chromosomal enhancer hubs. In vitro hub reconstitution reveals that TF motif variations impose distinct homotypic properties to their resident Lhx2/Ebf1/Ldb1 complexes, enabling formation of nucleoprotein condensates with solid phase characteristics. Live imaging and single molecule tracking of Lhx2/Ebf1 proteins in cultured OSNs confirm that assembly of transcription-competent solid condensates occurs in vivo under physiological protein concentrations. Thus, DNA sequence-induced homophilic nucleoprotein interactions provide a generalizable explanation for the stability and specificity of long-range genomic contacts that control cellular identity and function.},

Low-testosterone males had higher HSD17B2 expression in blood than high-testosterone males, as well as in brain areas related to social behaviors and testosterone production.

  abstract = {Hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are required for fertility in all mammalian species studied to date. In rodents, GnRH neuron cell bodies reside in the rostral hypothalamus, and most extend a single long neuronal process in the caudal direction to terminate at the median eminence (ME), the site of hormone secretion. The molecular cues that GnRH neurites use to grow and navigate to the ME during development, however, remain poorly described. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) identified mRNAs encoding Netrin-1, and its receptor, DCC, in the fetal preoptic area (POA) and mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), respectively, from gestational day 12.5 (GD12.5), a time when the first GnRH neurites extend toward the MBH. Moreover, a subpopulation of GnRH neurons from GD14.5 through GD18.5 express the Netrin-1 receptor, DCC, suggesting a role for Netrin-1/DCC signaling in GnRH neurite growth and/or guidance. In support of this notion, when GD15.5 POA explants, containing GnRH neurons actively extending neurites, were grown in three-dimensional collagen gels and challenged with exogenous Netrin-1 (100 ng/ml or 400 ng/ml) GnRH neurite growth was stimulated. In addition, Netrin-1 provided from a fixed source was able to stimulate outgrowth, although it did not appear to chemoattract GnRH neurites. Finally, the effects of Netrin-1 on the outgrowth of GnRH neurites could be inhibited by blocking either L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) with nifedipine (10 {\textmu}M), or ryanodine receptors with ryanodine (10 {\textmu}M). This is consistent with the role of Ca2+ from extra- and intracellular sources in Netrin-1/DCC-dependent growth cone motility in other neurons. These results indicate that Netrin-1 directly stimulates the growth of a subpopulation of GnRH neurites that express DCC, provide further understanding of the mechanisms by which GnRH nerve terminals arrive at their site of hormone secretion, and identify an additional neuronal population whose neurites utilize Netrin-1/DCC signaling for their development.},

We demonstrate that intramuscularly injected LNPs carrying SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA reach heart tissue, leading to proteome changes, suggesting immune activation and blood vessel damage. SCP-Nano generalizes to various types of nanocarriers, including liposomes, polyplexes, DNA origami and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), revealing that an AAV2 variant transduces adipocytes throughout the body. SCP-Nano enables comprehensive three-dimensional mapping of nanocarrier distribution throughout mouse bodies with high sensitivity and should accelerate the development of precise and safe nanocarrier-based therapeutics.},

Using inputs from the lateral habenula to interrogate the processing features of the mouse DRN, we uncovered 5-HT1A receptor-mediated recurrent connections between 5-HT neurons, refuting classical theories of autoinhibition. Cellular electrophysiology and imaging of a genetically encoded 5-HT sensor revealed that these recurrent inhibitory connections spanned the raphe, were slow, stochastic, strongly facilitating and gated spike output. These features collectively conveyed highly nonlinear dynamics to this network, generating excitation-driven inhibition and winner-take-all computations. In vivo optogenetic activation of lateral habenula inputs to DRN, at frequencies where these computations are predicted to ignite, transiently disrupted expression of a reward-conditioned response in an auditory conditioning task. Together, these data identify a core computation supported by an unsuspected slow serotonergic recurrent inhibitory network.},

After movement cessation, replays avoided the animal's previous path for 3 seconds. Chains of replays avoided self-repetition over a shorter timescale. We used a continuous attractor model of neural activity to demonstrate that neuronal fatigue both generates replay sequences and produces self-avoidance over the observed timescales. In addition, replay of past experience became predominant later into the stopping period, in a manner requiring cortical input. These results indicate a mechanism for replay generation that unexpectedly constrains which sequences can be produced across time.},

Here we present a computational strategy for the design of proteins that target neosurfaces, that is, surfaces arising from protein--ligand complexes. To develop this strategy, we leveraged a geometric deep learning approach based on learned molecular surface representations8,9 and experimentally validated binders against three drug-bound protein complexes: Bcl2--venetoclax, DB3--progesterone and PDF1--actinonin. All binders demonstrated high affinities and accurate specificities, as assessed by mutational and structural characterization. Remarkably, surface fingerprints previously trained only on proteins could be applied to neosurfaces induced by interactions with small molecules, providing a powerful demonstration of generalizability that is uncommon in other deep learning approaches. We anticipate that such designed chemically induced protein interactions will have the potential to expand the sensing repertoire and the assembly of new synthetic pathways in engineered cells for innovative drug-controlled cell-based therapies10.},

In fact, impairments in memory flexibility are associated with pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder or autism; however, the underlying mechanisms that enable memory flexibility are still poorly understood. Here, we identify transcriptional repressor Wilm's Tumor 1 (WT1) as a critical synaptic plasticity regulator that decreases memory strength, promoting memory flexibility. WT1 is activated in the hippocampus following induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) or learning. WT1 knockdown enhances CA1 neuronal excitability, LTP and long-term memory whereas its overexpression weakens memory retention. Moreover, forebrain WT1-deficient mice show deficits in both reversal, sequential learning tasks and contextual fear extinction, exhibiting impaired memory flexibility. We conclude that WT1 limits memory strength or promotes memory weakening, thus enabling memory flexibility, a process that is critical for learning from new experiences.},

However, the physiological function of anosmin-1 remains to be elucidated. In KS, disordered angiogenesis is observed in OB, resulting in its hypoplasia. In this study, we examined the involvement of anosmin-1 in angiogenic processes. Anosmin-1 was detected on the vessel-like structure in OB of chick embryos, and promoted the outgrowth of vascular sprouts as shown by assays of OB tissue culture. Cell migration, proliferation, and tube formation of endothelial cells were induced by treatment with anosmin-1 as well as vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), and further enhanced by treatment with both of them. We newly identified that anosmin-1 activated VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) by binding directly to it, and its downstream signaling molecules, phospholipase C{$\gamma$}1 (PLC{$\gamma$}1) and protein kinase C (PKC). These results suggest that anosmin-1 plays a key role in the angiogenesis of developing OB through the VEGFR2--PLC{$\gamma$}1--PKC axis by enhancing the VEGF function.},

By studying the delayed parturition phenotype of mice with uterine fibroblast deficiencies in the histone H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6B, we provide evidence that parturition timing is regulated by events that take place in early pregnancy. Immediately after copulation, uterine fibroblasts engage in a locus-specific epigenetic program that abruptly adjusts H3K27me3 levels across their genome. In the absence of KDM6B, many of the adjusted loci over-accumulate H3K27me3. This over-accumulation leads to nearby genes being misexpressed in mid-to-late gestation, a delayed effect partly attributable to a second locus-specific but KDM6B-independent process initiated within uterine fibroblasts soon after implantation. This second process employs progressive H3K27me3 loss to temporally structure post-midgestational patterns of gene induction. Further dissection of the ways uterine programming controls parturition timing may have relevance to human pregnancy complications such as preterm labor.},

Here we report that neural networks endowed with neuromodulated synaptic plasticity (allowing for self-directed learning) and identified through artificial metalearning (learning-to-learn) are able to perform both transitive inference and list linking and, further, express behavioral patterns widely observed in humans and animals. Crucially, only networks that adopt an `active' solution, in which items from past trials are reinstated in neural activity in recoded form, are capable of list linking. These results identify fully neural mechanisms for relational learning, and highlight a method for discovering such mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axons exit the olfactory epithelium (OE) and extend toward the olfactory bulb (OB) where they coalesce into glomeruli. Each OSN expresses only 1 of approximately 1,200 odor receptors (ORs). OSNs expressing the same OR are distributed in restricted zones of the OE. However, within a zone, the OSNs expressing a specific OR are not contiguous - distribution appears stochastic. Upon reaching the OB the OSN axons expressing the same OR reproducibly coalesce into two to three glomeruli. While ORs appear necessary for appropriate convergence of axons, a variety of adhesion associated molecules and activity-dependent mechanisms are also implicated. Recent data suggest pre-target OSN axon sorting may influence glomerular convergence. Here, using regional and OR-specific markers, we addressed the spatio-temporal properties associated with the onset of homotypic fasciculation in embryonic mice and assessed the degree to which subpopulations of axons remain segregated as they extend toward the nascent OB. We show that immediately upon crossing the basal lamina, axons uniformly turn sharply, usually at an approximately 90{$^\circ$} angle toward the OB. Molecularly defined subpopulations of axons show evidence of spatial segregation within the nascent nerve by embryonic day 12, within 48 hours of the first OSN axons crossing the basal lamina, but at least 72 hours before synapse formation in the developing OB. Homotypic fasciculation of OSN axons expressing the same OR appears to be a hierarchical process. While regional segregation occurs in the mesenchyme, the final convergence of OR-specific subpopulations does not occur until the axons reach the inner nerve layer of the OB.},

  abstract = {Episodic memories formed in early childhood rapidly decay, but their latent traces remain stored long term. These memories require the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) and seem to undergo a developmental critical period. It remains to be determined whether the maturation of parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs), a major mechanism of critical periods, contributes to memory development. Here, we show that episodic infantile learning significantly increases the levels of parvalbumin in the dHPC 48 h after training. Chemogenetic inhibition of PVIs before learning indicated that these neurons are required for infantile memory formation. A bilateral dHPC injection of the g-aminobutyric acid type A receptor agonist diazepam after training elicited long-term memory expression in infant rats, although direct PVI chemogenetic activation had no effect. Finally, PVI activity was required for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent maturation of memory competence, i.e., adult-like long-term memory expression. Thus, dHPC PVIs are critical for the formation of infantile memories and for memory development.},

Chromatin conformation capture using in situ Hi-C on fluorescence-activated cell-sorted olfactory sensory neurons and their progenitors shows that olfactory receptor gene clusters from 18 chromosomes make specific and robust interchromosomal contacts that increase with differentiation of the cells. These contacts are orchestrated by intergenic olfactory receptor enhancers, the `Greek islands', which first contribute to the formation of olfactory receptor compartments and then form a multi-chromosomal super-enhancer that associates with the single active olfactory receptor gene. The Greek-island-bound transcription factor LHX2 and adaptor protein LDB1 regulate the assembly and maintenance of olfactory receptor compartments, Greek island hubs and olfactory receptor transcription, providing mechanistic insights into and functional support for the role of trans interactions in gene expression.},

However, the alterations in cell signaling mechanisms critical for migration and final positioning of neurons in TSC remain unclear. Our detailed cellular analyses reveal that reduced Tsc2 in newborn neurons causes abnormalities in leading processes of migrating neurons, accompanied by significantly delayed migration. Importantly, we demonstrate that Reelin-Dab1 signaling is aberrantly regulated in TSC mouse models and in cortical tubers from TSC patients owing to enhanced expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cul5, a known mediator of pDab1 ubiquitination. Likewise, mTORC1 activation by Rheb overexpression generates similar neuronal and Reelin-Dab1 signaling defects, and directly upregulates Cul5 expression. Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin treatment or by reducing Cul5 largely restores normal leading processes and positioning of migrating neurons. Thus, disrupted Reelin-Dab1 signaling is critically involved in the neuronal migration defects of TSC.},

KS is linked to variants in \&gt;34 genes, which are scattered across the human genome and show disparate biological functions. Although the genetic basis of KS is well studied, the mechanisms by which disruptions of these diverse genes cause the same outcome of KS are not fully understood. Here we show that disruptions of KS-linked genes affect the same biological processes, indicating convergent molecular mechanisms underlying KS. We carried out machine learning-based predictions and found that KS-linked mutations in heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS6ST1) are likely loss-of-function mutations. We next disrupted Hs6st1 and another KS-linked gene, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1), in mouse neuronal cells and measured transcriptome changes using RNA sequencing. We found that disruptions of Hs6st1 and Fgfr1 altered genes in the same biological processes, including the upregulation of genes in extracellular pathways and the downregulation of genes in chromatin pathways. Moreover, we performed genomics and bioinformatics analyses and found that Hs6st1 and Fgfr1 regulate gene transcription likely via the transcription factor Sox9/Sox10 and the chromatin regulator Chd7, which are also associated with KS. Together, our results demonstrate how different KS-linked genes work coordinately in a convergent signaling pathway to regulate the same biological processes, thus providing new insights into KS.},

Odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) mutants show enhanced attraction to human skin temperature and increased heat-evoked neuronal activity in foreleg sensory neurons. Ir140, a foreleg-enriched member of the ionotropic receptor (IR) superfamily of sensory receptors, is up-regulated in Orco mutant legs. Ir140, Orco double mutants do not show the enhanced heat seeking seen in Orco single mutants, suggesting that up-regulation of Ir140 in the foreleg is a key mechanism underlying sensory compensation in Orco mutants. Because Orco expression is sparse in legs, this sensory compensation requires an indirect, long-range mechanism. Our findings highlight how female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, despite suffering olfactory sensory loss, maintain the overall effectiveness of their host-seeking behavior by up-regulating attraction to human skin temperature, further enhancing their status as the most dangerous predator of humans.},

  abstract = {Olfactory receptors (ORs) mediate olfactory chemo-sensation in OR neurons. Herein, we have demonstrated that the OR chemo-sensing machinery functions in pancreatic {$\beta$}-cells and modulates insulin secretion. First, we found several OR isoforms, including OLFR15 and OLFR821, to be expressed in pancreatic islets and a {$\beta$}-cell line, MIN6. Immunostaining revealed OLFR15 and OLFR821 to be uniformly expressed in pancreatic {$\beta$}-cells. In addition, mRNAs of Olfr15 and Olfr821 were detected in single MIN6 cells. These results indicate that multiple ORs are simultaneously expressed in individual {$\beta$}-cells. Octanoic acid, which is a medium-chain fatty acid contained in food and reportedly interacts with OLFR15, potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), thereby improving glucose tolerance in vivo. GSIS potentiation by octanoic acid was confirmed in isolated pancreatic islets and MIN6 cells and was blocked by OLFR15 knockdown. While G{$\alpha$}olfexpression was not detectable in {$\beta$}-cells, experiments using inhibitors and siRNA revealed that the pathway dependent on phospholipase C-inositol triphosphate, rather than cAMP-protein kinase A, mediates GSIS potentiation via OLFR15. These findings suggest that the OR system in pancreatic {$\beta$}-cells has a chemo-sensor function allowing recognition of environmental substances obtained from food, and potentiates insulin secretion in a cell-autonomous manner, thereby modulating systemic glucose metabolism.},

These meta-modules show dynamic cell subtype specificities throughout cortical development, with several developmental meta-modules displaying spatiotemporal expression patterns that allude to potential roles in cell fate specification. We validated the expression of these modules in primary human cortical tissues. These include meta-module 20, a module elevated in FEZF2+ deep layer neurons that includes TSHZ3, a transcription factor associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Human cortical chimeroid experiments validated that both FEZF2 and TSHZ3 are required to drive module 20 activity and deep layer neuron specification but through distinct modalities. These studies demonstrate how meta-atlases can engender further mechanistic analyses of cortical fate specification.},

Here, we show that SPW-Rs coincide with transient brain-wide increase of functional connectivity. The diversity in SPW-R features was related to slower excitability fluctuations in cortical and subcortical areas. In return, SPW-Rs correlated with the timing, sign, and magnitude of partner structure responses. Our findings provide the most extensive survey of spiking activity surrounding hippocampal SPW-Rs to date.           ,              During periods of disengagement from the environment, transient population bursts, known as sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs), occur sporadically. While numerous experiments have characterized the bidirectional relationship between SPW-Rs and activity in chosen brain areas, the topographic relationship between different segments of the hippocampus and brain-wide target areas has not been studied at high temporal and spatial resolution. Yet, such knowledge is necessary to infer the direction of communication. We analyzed two publicly available datasets with simultaneous high-density silicon probe recordings from across the mouse forebrain. We found that SPW-Rs coincide with a transient brain-wide increase in functional connectivity. In addition, we show that the diversity in SPW-R features, such as their incidence, magnitude, and intrahippocampal topography in the septotemporal axis, are correlated with slower excitability fluctuations in cortical and subcortical areas. Further, variations in SPW-R features correlated with the timing, sign, and magnitude of downstream responses with large-amplitude SPW-Rs followed by transient silence in extrahippocampal structures. Our findings expand on previous results and demonstrate that the activity patterns in extrahippocampal structures depend both on the intrahippocampal topographic origin and magnitude of hippocampal SPW-Rs.},

Seizure susceptibility and hippocampal-prefrontal cortex coherence in awake behaving animals, processes that are disrupted in mice deficient in microglia-enriched genes, are also normal. Similarly, eye-specific segregation of inputs into the lateral geniculate nucleus proceeds normally in the absence of microglia. Single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses of neurons and astrocytes did not uncover any substantial perturbation caused by microglial absence.

  abstract = {Transcriptional activation of the embryonic genome (EGA) is a major developmental landmark enabling the embryo to become independent from maternal control. The magnitude and control of transcriptional reprogramming during this event across mammals remains poorly understood. Here, we developed Smart-seq+50 for high sensitivity, full-length transcript coverage and simultaneous capture of 50 transcript information from single cells and single embryos. Using Smart-seq+50, we profiled 34 developmental stages in 5 mammalian species and provide an extensive characterization of the transcriptional repertoire of early development before, during, and after EGA. We demonstrate widespread transposable element (TE)-driven transcription across species, including, remarkably, of DNA transposons. We identify 19,657 TE-driven genic transcripts, suggesting extensive TE co-option in early development over evolutionary timescales. TEs display similar expression dynamics across species and species-specific patterns, suggesting shared and divergent regulation. Our work provides a powerful resource for understanding transcriptional regulation of mammalian development.},

  abstract = {Optical imaging plays a central role in biology and medicine but is hindered by light scattering in live tissue. We report the counterintuitive observation that strongly absorbing molecules can achieve optical transparency in live animals. We explored the physics behind this observation and found that when strongly absorbing molecules dissolve in water, they can modify the refractive index of the aqueous medium through the Kramers-Kronig relations to match that of high-index tissue components such as lipids. We have demonstrated that our straightforward approach can reversibly render a live mouse body transparent to allow visualization of a wide range of deep-seated structures and activities. This work suggests that the search for high-performance optical clearing agents should focus on strongly absorbing molecules.           ,              Editor's summary                            Optical imaging of biological tissues is hindered by the scattering and, to a lesser extent, absorption of light that limits the penetration depth. Ou               et al               . addressed this problem through an approach that at first may seem counterintuitive: the introduction of highly absorbing molecules (see the Perspective by Rowlands and Gorecki). The authors show that the addition of common dye molecules that absorb in the near ultraviolet and blue regions improve optical transparency in nearby longer wavelengths. In essence, by causing sharp absorption in the blue region, the refractive index in the red part of the spectrum is increased without increasing absorption. The addition of tartrazine was able to make the skin of a live rodent temporarily transparent. ---Marc S. Lavine                        ,                             INTRODUCTION               A challenge in trying to image biological matter is that its complex structure causes opacity because of unwanted light scattering. This scattering results from refractive index mismatches among the components of biological tissues, limiting the penetration depth of optical imaging. The desire to see inside biological tissue and uncover the fundamental processes of life has spurred extensive research into deep-tissue optical imaging methods, such as two-photon microscopy, near-infrared-II fluorescence imaging, and optical tissue clearing. However, these methods either lack sufficient penetration depth and resolution or are unsuitable for living animals. Therefore, the ability to achieve optical transparency in live animals holds promise for transforming many optical imaging techniques.                                         RATIONALE               We hypothesized that strongly absorbing molecules can achieve optical transparency in live biological tissues. By applying the Lorentz oscillator model for the dielectric properties of tissue components and absorbing molecules, we predicted that dye molecules with sharp absorption resonances in the near-ultraviolet spectrum (300 to 400 nm) and blue region of the visible spectrum (400 to 500 nm) are effective in raising the real part of the refractive index of the aqueous medium at longer wavelengths when dissolved in water, which is in agreement with the Kramers-Kronig relations. As a result, water-soluble dyes can effectively reduce the RI contrast between water and lipids, leading to optical transparency of live biological tissues.                                         RESULTS               Following our theory, we found that an aqueous solution of a common food color approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, tartrazine, has the effect of reversibly making the skin, muscle, and connective tissues transparent in live rodents. We conducted experiments in both tissue-mimicking scattering hydrogels and ex vivo biological tissues. These tests confirmed the mechanism underlying our observations and showcased the achievable spatial resolution down to the micrometer level through millimeters of scattering medium once transparency is attained. By using absorbing dye molecules, we can transform the typically opaque abdomen of a live mouse into a transparent medium. This ``transparent abdomen'' allows for direct visualization of fluorescent protein--labeled enteric neurons, capturing their movements that mirror the underlying gut motility in live mice. This enabled us to generate time-evolving maps that depict mouse gut motility and the diversity of movement patterns. To demonstrate the generalizability of this approach, we also applied dye solutions topically to the scalp of a mouse head for visualizing cerebral blood vessels and to the mouse hindlimb for high-resolution microscopic imaging of muscle sarcomeres.                                         CONCLUSION               Overall, we report the counterintuitive observation that strongly absorbing molecules can achieve optical transparency in live animals. The Lorentz oscillator model, which underlies this unusual observation, predicts that molecules with low resonance frequencies (long absorption wavelengths), sharp absorption peaks, and rich delocalized electrons are more effective candidates at raising the refractive index of the aqueous medium than are conventional optical clearing agents. Our approach also presents opportunities for visualizing the structure, activity, and functions of deep-seated tissues and organs without the need for surgical removal or the replacement of overlying tissues with transparent windows. Some limitations remain for this method, including reduced but not eliminated scattering owing to the challenge of matching refractive indices in heterogeneous tissues and achievable penetration depth depending on the diffusion of absorbing molecules.                                                   Achieving optical transparency in live mice with absorbing dye molecules.                   Strongly absorbing molecules dissolved in water can modify the RI of the aqueous medium through the Kramers-Kronig relations to match that of lipids. This approach can render various samples transparent, including scattering phantoms, chicken breast tissue, and live mouse body for visualizing a wide range of deep-seated structures and activities.

However, insight into the genes and pathways they control is lacking, hindering the understanding of their function. Here, we identify 2,963 conserved gene targets for 1,590 HARs and their orthologs in human and chimpanzee neural stem cells (NSCs). Conserved gene targets are enriched for neurodevelopmental functions and are overrepresented among differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in human NSCs (hNSCs) and chimpanzee NSCs (cNSCs) as well as in human versus non-human primate brains. Species-specific gene targets do not converge on any function and are not enriched among DEGs. HAR targets also show cell-type-specific expression in the human fetal brain, including in outer radial glia, which are linked to cortical expansion. Our findings support that HARs influence brain evolution by altering the expression of ancestral gene targets shared between human and chimpanzee rather than by gaining new targets in human and facilitate hypothesis-directed studies of HAR biology.},

  abstract = {An increase in protein synthesis following learning is a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved mechanism of long-term memory. To maintain homeostasis, this protein synthesis must be counterbalanced by mechanisms such as protein degradation. Recent studies reported that macroautophagy/ autophagy, a major protein degradation mechanism, is required for long-term memory formation. However, how learning regulates autophagy and recruits it into long-term memory formation remains to be established. Here, we show that inhibitory avoidance in rats significantly increases the levels of autophagy and lysosomal degradation proteins, including BECN1/beclin 1, LC3-II, SQSTM1/p62 and LAMP1, as well as autophagic flux in the hippocampus. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition or targeted molecular disruption of the learning-induced autophagy impairs long-term memory, leaving short-term memory intact. The increase in autophagy proteins results from active translation of their mRNA and not from changes in their total mRNA levels. Additionally, the induction of autophagy requires the immediate early gene Arc/Arg3.1. Finally, in contrast to classical regulation of autophagy in other systems, we found that the increase in autophagy upon learning is dispensable for the increase in protein synthesis. We conclude that coupling between learning-induced translation and autophagy, rather than translation per se, is an essential mechanism of long-term memory.},

Using rats and mice, we assessed the cell-type-specific contribution of hippocampal insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), a polypeptide regulated by learning and required for long-term memory formation. The highest level of hippocampal IGF2 was detected in pericytes, the multi-functional mural cells of the microvessels that regulate blood flow, vessel formation, the blood-brain barrier, and immune cell entry into the central nervous system. Learning significantly increased pericytic Igf2 expression in the hippocampus, particularly in the highly vascularized stratum lacunosum moleculare and stratum moleculare layers of the dentate gyrus. Igf2 increases required neuronal activity. Regulated hippocampal Igf2 knockout in pericytes, but not in fibroblasts or neurons, impaired long-term memories and blunted the learning-dependent increase of neuronal immediate early genes (IEGs). Thus, neuronal activity-driven signaling from pericytes to neurons via IGF2 is essential for long-term memory.},

Here we show that, in mice, the initial formation of synapses on cerebellar Purkinje cells involves a presynaptic protein---CBLN1, a member of the C1q protein family---that is secreted by all types of excitatory inputs. The molecular program then evolves only in one of the Purkinje cell inputs, the inferior olivary neurons, with the additional expression of the presynaptic secreted proteins C1QL1, CRTAC1 and LGI2. These molecules work in concert to specify the mature connectivity pattern on the Purkinje cell target. These results show that some inputs actively and gradually specify their synaptic molecular identity, while others rely on the `original molecular code'. Thus, the molecular specification of excitatory synapses, crucial for proper circuit function, is acquired in a stepwise manner during mouse postnatal development and obeys input-specific rules.},

However, the biological mechanisms by which poverty-related adversities can ``get under the skin'' to influence social behavior are poorly understood and cannot be easily ascertained using human research alone. This study utilized a rodent model of ``scarcity-adversity,'' which encompasses material resource deprivation (scarcity) and reduced caregiving quality (adversity), to explore how early-life scarcity-adversity causally influences social behavior via disruption of developing stress physiology. Results showed that early-life scarcityadversity exposure increased social avoidance when offspring were tested in a social approach test in periadolescence. Furthermore, early-life scarcity-adversity led to blunted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity as measured via adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT) reactivity following the social approach test. Western blot analysis of brain tissue revealed that glucocorticoid receptor levels in the dorsal (but not ventral) hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex were significantly elevated in scarcity-adversity reared rats following the social approach test. Finally, pharmacological repletion of CORT in scarcity-adversity reared peri-adolescents rescued social behavior. Our findings provide causal support that early-life scarcity-adversity exposure negatively impacts social development via a hypocorticosteronismdependent mechanism, which can be targeted via CORT administration to rescue social behavior.},

Our findings combined with the broader literature promote the importance of cultivating social skills in support of EF development and maintenance across the lifespan.

To date, several loci have been identified to cause these disorders, but only 30\% of cases exhibit mutations in known genes. Recently, murine studies have demonstrated a critical role of the prokineticin pathway in olfactory bulb morphogenesis and GnRH secretion. Therefore, we hypothesize that mutations in prokineticin 2 (PROK2) underlie some cases of KS in humans and that animals deficient in Prok2 would be hypogonadotropic. One hundred IHH probands (50 nIHH and 50 KS) with no known mutations were examined for mutations in the PROK2 gene. Mutant PROK2s were examined in functional studies, and the reproductive phenotype of the Prok2-/- mice was also investigated. Two brothers with KS and their sister with nIHH harbored a homozygous deletion in the PROK2 gene (p.[I55fsX1]+[I55fsX1]). Another asymptomatic brother was heterozygous for the deletion, whereas both parents (deceased) had normal reproductive histories. The identified deletion results in a truncated PROK2 protein of 27 amino acids (rather than 81 in its mature form) that lacks bioactivity. In addition, Prok2-/- mice with olfactory bulb defects exhibited disrupted GnRH neuron migration, resulting in a dramatic decrease in GnRH neuron population in the hypothalamus as well as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Homozygous loss-of-function PROK2 mutations cause both KS and nIHH.},

OR gene choice is mediated by a multichromosomal enhancer hub that activates transcription at a single OR3,4, followed by OR-translation-dependent feedback that stabilizes this choice5,6. Here, using single-cell genomics, we show formation of many competing hubs with variable enhancer composition, only one of which retains euchromatic features and transcriptional competence. Furthermore, we provide evidence that OR transcription recruits enhancers and reinforces enhancer hub activity locally, whereas OR RNA inhibits transcription of competing ORs over distance, promoting transition to transcriptional singularity. Whereas OR transcription is sufficient to break the symmetry between equipotent enhancer hubs, OR translation stabilizes transcription at the prevailing hub, indicating that there may be sequential non-coding and coding mechanisms that are implemented by OR alleles for transcriptional prevalence. We propose that coding OR mRNAs possess non-coding functions that influence nuclear architecture, enhance their own transcription and inhibit transcription from their competitors, with generalizable implications for probabilistic cell fate decisions.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that the topography of thalamocortical (TC) axon projections is initiated before they reach the cortex, in the ventral telencephalon (VTel). However, at this point, the molecular mechanisms patterning the topography of TC projections in the VTel remains poorly understood. Here, we show that a long-range, high-rostral to low-caudal gradient of Netrin-1 in the VTel is required in vivo for the topographic sorting of TC axons to distinct cortical domains. We demonstrate that Netrin-1 is a chemoattractant for rostral thalamic axons but functions as a chemorepulsive cue for caudal thalamic axons. In accordance with this model, DCC is expressed in a high-rostromedial to low-caudolateral gradient in the dorsal thalamus (DTh), whereas three Unc5 receptors (Unc5A--C) show graded expression in the reverse orientation. Finally, we show that DCC is required for the attraction of rostromedial thalamic axons to the Netrin-1--rich, anterior part of the VTel, whereas DCC and Unc5A/C receptors are required for the repulsion of caudolateral TC axons from the same Netrin-1--rich region of the VTel. Our results demonstrate that a long-range gradient of Netrin-1 acts as a counteracting force from ephrin-A5 to control the topography of TC projections before they enter the cortex.},

Mouse gestation lasts only 3 weeks, during which the genome orchestrates the astonishing transformation of a single-cell zygote into a free-living pup composed of more than 500 million cells. Here, to establish a global framework for exploring mammalian development, we applied optimized single-cell combinatorial indexing               3               to profile the transcriptional states of 12.4 million nuclei from 83 embryos, precisely staged at 2- to 6-hour intervals spanning late gastrulation (embryonic day 8) to birth (postnatal day 0). From these data, we annotate hundreds of cell types and explore the ontogenesis of the posterior embryo during somitogenesis~and of kidney, mesenchyme, retina and early neurons. We leverage the temporal resolution and sampling depth of these whole-embryo snapshots, together with published data               4--8               from earlier timepoints, to construct a rooted tree of cell-type relationships that spans the entirety of prenatal development, from zygote to birth. Throughout this tree, we systematically nominate genes encoding transcription factors and other proteins as candidate drivers of the in vivo differentiation of hundreds of cell types. Remarkably, the most marked temporal shifts in cell states are observed within one hour of birth and presumably underlie the massive physiological adaptations that must accompany the successful transition of a mammalian fetus to life outside the womb.},

Without a unifying principle, each experiment seemingly uncovers new anomalies or coding types. Here, we provide a unifying principle that the mental representation of space is an emergent property of latent higher-order sequence learning. Treating space as a sequence resolves numerous phenomena and suggests that the place field mapping methodology that interprets sequential neuronal responses in Euclidean terms might itself be a source of anomalies. Our model, clone-structured causal graph (CSCG), employs higher-order graph scaffolding to learn latent representations by mapping aliased egocentric sensory inputs to unique contexts. Learning to compress sequential and episodic experiences using CSCGs yields allocentric cognitive maps that are suitable for planning, introspection, consolidation, and abstraction. By explicating the role of Euclidean place field mapping and demonstrating how latent sequential representations unify myriad observed phenomena, our work positions the hippocampus in a sequence-centric paradigm, challenging the prevailing space-centric view.           ,              Mental representations of space emerge from sequence learning on egocentric sensory inputs.},

Recent crystal structures provide insights into inactive states of several GPCRs.

We generated a camelid antibody fragment (nanobody) to the human {$\beta$}2 adrenergic receptor ({$\beta$}2AR) that exhibits G protein-like behaviour, and obtained an agonist-bound, active-state crystal structure of the receptor-nanobody complex. Comparison with the inactive {$\beta$}2AR structure reveals subtle changes in the binding pocket; however, these small changes are associated with an 11\,{\AA} outward movement of the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 6, and rearrangements of transmembrane segments 5 and 7 that are remarkably similar to those observed in opsin, an active form of rhodopsin.

The paradigm of GPCR signalling is the activation of a heterotrimeric GTP binding protein (G protein) by an agonist-occupied receptor. The {$\beta$}2 adrenergic receptor ({$\beta$}2AR) activation of Gs, the stimulatory G protein for adenylyl cyclase, has long been a model system for GPCR signalling. Here we present the crystal structure of the active state ternary complex composed of agonist-occupied monomeric {$\beta$}2AR and nucleotide-free Gs heterotrimer. The principal interactions between the {$\beta$}2AR and Gs involve the amino- and carboxy-terminal {$\alpha$}-helices of Gs, with conformational changes propagating to the nucleotide-binding pocket. The largest conformational changes in the {$\beta$}2AR include a 14\,{\AA} outward movement at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 6 (TM6) and an {$\alpha$}-helical extension of the cytoplasmic end of TM5. The most surprising observation is a major displacement of the {$\alpha$}-helical domain of G{$\alpha$}s relative to the Ras-like GTPase domain. This crystal structure represents the first high-resolution view of transmembrane signalling by a GPCR.},

In-flight, most hippocampal place cells were socially modulated and represented the identity and sex of conspecifics. Upon social interactions, neurons represented specific interaction types. During active observation, neurons encoded the bat's own position and head direction, together with the position, direction, and identity of multiple conspecifics. Identity-coding neurons encoded the same bat across contexts. The strength of identity coding was modulated by sex, hierarchy, and social affiliation. Thus, hippocampal neurons form a multidimensional sociospatial representation of the natural world.},

Here, we reveal gut microbiome--mediated urea nitrogen recycling in hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels (               Ictidomys tridecemlineatus               ). Ureolytic gut microbes incorporate urea nitrogen into metabolites that are absorbed by the host, with the nitrogen reincorporated into the squirrel's protein pool. Urea nitrogen recycling is greatest after prolonged fasting in late winter, when urea transporter abundance in gut tissue and urease gene abundance in the microbiome are highest. These results reveal a functional role for the gut microbiome during hibernation and suggest mechanisms by which urea nitrogen recycling may contribute to protein balance in other monogastric animals.                        ,              While they sleep                            Hibernation has evolved to remove animals from seasonal periods that are especially challenging for survival.

One particularly challenging aspect is the lack of dietary nitrogen, which can lead to protein imbalance. Regan               et al               . looked at gut microbiome activity in hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels and found that symbionts recycled nitrogen from urea into their own metabolites, which were then incorporated by the squirrels, allowing them to maintain protein balance (see the Perspective by Sommer and B{\"a}ckhed).

Many well-known scientific journals have called for attention to extranasal functions of ecnomotopic olfactory receptors.

We developed an in vivo fate-mapping strategy that enabled us to follow OSN maturation and axon extension beginning at basal cell division. In parallel, we mapped the molecular development of OSNs beginning at basal cell division, including the onset of OR expression. Our data show that ORs are first expressed around 4 d following basal cell division, 24 h after OSN axons have reached the OB. Over the next 6+ days the OSN axons navigate the OB nerve layer and ultimately coalesce in glomeruli. These data provide a previously unidentified perspective on the role of ORs in homophilic OSN axon adhesion and lead us to propose a new model dividing axon extension into two phases. Phase I is OR-independent and accounts for up to 50\% of the time during which axons approach the OB and begin navigating the olfactory nerve layer. Phase II is OR-dependent and concludes as OSN axons coalesce in glomeruli.},

  abstract = {In mammals, odorants induce various behavioral responses that are critical to the survival of the individual and species. Binding signals of odorants to odorant receptors (ORs) expressed in the olfactory epithelia are converted to an odor map, a pattern of activated glomeruli, in the olfactory bulb (OB). This topographic map is used to identify odorants for memory-based learned decisions. In the embryo, a coarse olfactory map is generated in the OB by a combination of dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior targeting of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), using specific sets of axon-guidance molecules. During the process of OSN projection, odor signals are sorted into distinct odor qualities in separate functional domains in the OB. Odor information is then conveyed by the projection neurons, mitral/tufted cells, to various regions in the olfactory cortex, particularly to the amygdala for innate olfactory decisions. Although the basic architecture of hard-wired circuits is generated by a genetic program, innate olfactory responses are modified by neonatal odor experience in an activity-dependent manner. Stimulus-driven OR activity promotes post-synaptic events and dendrite selection in the responding glomeruli making them larger. As a result, enhanced odor inputs in neonates establish imprinted olfactory memory that induces attractive responses in adults, even when the odor quality is innately aversive. In this paper, I will provide an overview of the recent progress made in the olfactory circuit formation in mice.},

Due to their scantiness and particular location, little is known about the presence of temporally and spatially restricted CAM subclasses during development, health and perturbation. Here we combined single-cell RNA sequencing, time-of-flight mass cytometry and single-cell spatial transcriptomics with fate mapping and advanced immunohistochemistry to comprehensively characterize the immune system at human CNS interfaces with over 356,000 analyzed transcriptomes from 102 individuals. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of resident and engrafted myeloid cells in the brains of 15 individuals with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, revealing compartment-specific engraftment rates across different CNS interfaces. Integrated multiomic and high-resolution spatial transcriptome analysis of anatomically dissected glioblastoma samples shows regionally distinct myeloid cell-type distributions driven by hypoxia. Notably, the glioblastoma-associated hypoxia response was distinct from the physiological hypoxia response in fetal microglia and CAMs. Our results highlight myeloid diversity at the interfaces of the human CNS with the periphery and provide insights into the complexities of the human brain's immune system.},

This phenomenon---referred to as ``infantile'' and ``childhood amnesia''---has been widely observed across species and is characterized by rapid forgetting from birth until early childhood. While a number of studies have focused on infancy, few studies have examined the persistence of memory for newly learned associations during the putative period of childhood amnesia. In this study, we investigated forgetting in 137 children ages 3--5 years old by using an interactive storybook task. We assessed associative memory between subjects after 5-min, 24-h, and 1-week delay periods. Across all delays, we observed a significant increase in memory performance with age. While all ages demonstrated above-chance memory performance after 5-min and 24-h delays, we observed chance-level memory accuracy in 3-year-olds following a 1-week delay. The observed age differences in associative memory support the proposal that hippocampaldependent memory systems undergo rapid development during the preschool years. These data have the potential to inform future work translating memory persistence and malleability research from rodent models to humans by establishing timescales at which we expect young children to forget newly learned associations.},

Image-based transcriptomics approaches offer an avenue to study such behaviors, yet these approaches have been hindered by the massive density of bacterial messenger RNA. To overcome this challenge, we combined 1000-fold volumetric expansion with multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to create bacterial-MERFISH. This method enables high-throughput, spatially resolved profiling of thousands of operons within individual bacteria. Using bacterial-MERFISH, we dissected the response of Escherichia coli to carbon starvation, systematically mapped subcellular RNA organization, and charted the adaptation of a gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to micrometer-scale niches in the mammalian colon. We envision that bacterial-MERFISH will be broadly applicable to the study of bacterial single-cell heterogeneity in diverse, spatially structured, and native environments.},

Here, we demonstrate that Nhlh genes control vomeronasal receptor expression in the developing murine olfactory placode associated with the generation of the first GnRH neurons at embryonic days (E)10--12. Inactivation of {\ss}2-microglobulin ({\ss}2-m), which selectively affects surface expression of V2Rs, dramatically decreased the number of GnRH neurons in the Nhlh2 mutant background, preventing rescue of fertility in female Nhlh2 mutant mice by male pheromones. In addition, we show that GnRH neurons generated after E12 fail to establish synaptic connections to the vomeronasal amygdala, suggesting the existence of functionally specialized subpopulations of GnRH neurons, which process pheromonal information.},

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of early and chronic MPH treatment on the striatum focusing on amino acid profile, glutamatergic excitotoxicity, redox status, neuroinflammation and glial cell responses. Male Wistar rats were treated with MPH (2.0 mg/kg) or saline solution from the 15th to the 44th postnatal day. Biochemical and histological analyses were conducted after the last administration. MPH altered the amino acid profile in the striatum, increasing glutamate and ornithine levels, while decreasing the levels of serine, phenylalanine, and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, valine, and isoleucine). Glutamate uptake and Na+,K+-ATPase activity were decreased in the striatum of MPH-treated rats as well as increased ATP levels, as indicator of glutamatergic excitotoxicity. Moreover, MPH caused lipid peroxidation and nitrative stress, increased TNF alpha expression, and induced high levels of astrocytes, and led to a decrease in BDNF levels. In summary, our results suggest that chronic early-age treatment with MPH induces parallel activation of damage-associated pathways in the striatum and increases its vulnerability during the juvenile period. In addition, data presented here contribute to shedding light on the mechanisms underlying MPH-induced striatal damage and its potential implications for neurodevelopmental disorders.},

Extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules are expressed early in the developing pathway and are proposed to have a role in its initial establishment. During later embryonic development, OSNs sort out and target specific glomeruli to form precise, complex topographic projections. We hypothesized that ECM cues may help to establish this complex topography. The aim of this study was to characterize expression of ECM molecules during the period of glomerulogenesis, when synaptic contacts are forming. We examined expression of laminin-1, perlecan, tenascin-C and CSPGs and found a coordinated pattern of expression of these cues in the pathway. These appear to restrict axons to the pathway while promoting axon outgrowth within. Thus, ECM molecules are present in dynamic spatio-temporal positions to affect OSN axons as they navigate to the olfactory bulb and establish synapses.},

Upon intranasal administration, Lp released specific payload molecules within the OE, with subsequent transport and accumulation in the brain. The therapeutic efficacy of Lp was further validated by the recombinant production and secretion of appetite-regulating hormones. When administered intranasally in a murine model of obesity prevention, the engineered Lp significantly alleviated obesity-related symptoms. This was evidenced by decreased appetite, reduced body weight gain, and improved glucose metabolism and fat mass deposition. Our study demonstrates the capability of Lp as an intranasal delivery vehicle, emphasizing its potential for brain-targeted therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {The postnatal mammalian olfactory epithelium (OE) represents a major aspect of the peripheral olfactory system. It is a pseudostratified tissue that originates from the olfactory placode and is composed of diverse cells, some of which are specialized receptor neurons capable of transducing odorant stimuli to afford the perception of smell (olfaction). The OE is known to offer a tractable miniature model for studying the systematic generation of neurons and glia that typify neural tissue development. During OE development, stem/progenitor cells that will become olfactory sensory neurons and/or non-neuronal cell types display fine spatiotemporal expression of neuronal and non-neuronal genes that ensures their proper proliferation, differentiation, survival, and regeneration. Many factors, including transcription and epigenetic factors, have been identified as key regulators of the expression of such requisite genes to permit normal OE morphogenesis. Typically, specific interactive regulatory networks established between transcription and epigenetic factors/cofactors orchestrate histogenesis in the embryonic and adult OE. Hence, investigation of these regulatory networks critical for OE development promises to disclose strategies that may be employed in manipulating the stepwise transition of olfactory precursor cells to become fully differentiated and functional neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. Such strategies potentially offer formidable means of replacing injured or degenerated neural cells as therapeutics for nervous system perturbations. This review recapitulates the developmental cellular diversity of the olfactory neuroepithelium and discusses findings on how the precise and cooperative molecular control by transcriptional and epigenetic machinery is indispensable for OE ontogeny.},

Hippocampal place cell activity spans spatial and non-spatial episodes, but whether hippocampal activity encodes entire sequences of events relative to reward is unknown. Here, to test this possibility, we performed two-photon imaging of hippocampal CA1 as mice navigated virtual environments with changing hidden reward locations. We found that when the reward moved, a subpopulation of neurons updated their firing fields to the same relative position with respect to reward, constructing behavioral timescale sequences spanning the entire task. Over learning, this reward-relative representation became more robust as additional neurons were recruited, and changes in reward-relative firing often preceded behavioral adaptations following reward relocation. Concurrently, the spatial environment code was maintained through a parallel, dynamic subpopulation rather than through dedicated cell classes. These findings reveal how hippocampal ensembles flexibly encode multiple aspects of experience while amplifying behaviorally relevant information.},

Whether restoring neurological functions requires directed regeneration of axons from specific neuronal subpopulations to their natural target regions remains unclear. To address this question, we applied projection-specific and comparative single-nucleus RNA sequencing to identify neuronal subpopulations that restore walking after incomplete SCI. We show that chemoattracting and guiding the transected axons of these neurons to their natural target region led to substantial recovery of walking after complete SCI in mice, whereas regeneration of axons simply across the lesion had no effect. Thus, reestablishing the natural projections of characterized neurons forms an essential part of axon regeneration strategies aimed at restoring lost neurological functions.           ,              Editor's summary                            Although several experimental approaches have shown positive results in axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI), complete recovery of motor functions remains an elusive target. Squair               et al               . hypothesized that restoration of complete axonal projection of a selected neuronal population to their natural target could promote better functional recovery. After using single-cell RNA sequencing to identify the most promising neuronal population, the authors showed that promoting axonal growth and path guidance to their natural target in this population restored walking in mice after complete SCI. By contrast, broad axonal restoration across the lesion had no effect, suggesting that a more targeted approach is necessary for functional recovery after SCI. ---Mattia Maroso                        ,              Restoring axonal projections of selected neurons to their target is critical for functional recovery after spinal cord injury in mice.},

In the remaining single Y-gene deletants, spermatogenesis appeared unperturbed, but testis transcription was still altered. Multigene deletions, including a human-infertility AZFa model, exhibited phenotypes absent in single Y deletants.

  abstract = {Old age is associated with a decline in cognitive function and an increase in neurodegenerative disease risk1. Brain ageing is complex and is accompanied by many cellular changes2. Furthermore, the influence that aged cells have on neighbouring cells and how this contributes to tissue decline is unknown. More generally, the tools to systematically address this question in ageing tissues have not yet been developed. Here we generate a spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics brain atlas of 4.2 million cells from 20 distinct ages across the adult lifespan and across two rejuvenating interventions---exercise and partial reprogramming. We build spatial ageing clocks, machine learning models trained on this spatial transcriptomics atlas, to identify spatial and cell-type-specific transcriptomic fingerprints of ageing, rejuvenation and disease, including for rare cell types. Using spatial ageing clocks and deep learning, we find that T cells, which increasingly infiltrate the brain with age, have a marked pro-ageing proximity effect on neighbouring cells. Surprisingly, neural stem cells have a strong pro-rejuvenating proximity effect on neighbouring cells. We also identify potential mediators of the pro-ageing effect of T cells and the pro-rejuvenating effect of neural stem cells on their neighbours. These results suggest that rare cell types can have a potent influence on their neighbours and could be targeted to counter tissue ageing. Spatial ageing clocks represent a useful tool for studying cell--cell interactions in spatial contexts and should allow scalable assessment of the efficacy of interventions for ageing and disease.},

STING binds TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). TBK1 mutations are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the STING pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of further neurodegenerative diseases. To test whether STING activation is sufficient to induce neurodegeneration, we analysed a mouse model that expresses the constitutively active STING variant N153S. In this model, we focused on dopaminergic neurons, which are particularly sensitive to stress and represent a circumscribed population that can be precisely quantified. In adult mice expressing N153S STING, the number of dopaminergic neurons was smaller than in controls, as was the density of dopaminergic axon terminals and the concentration of dopamine in the striatum. We also observed alpha-synuclein pathology and a lower density of synaptic puncta. Neuroinflammation was quantified by staining astroglia and microglia, by measuring mRNAs, proteins and nuclear translocation of transcription factors. These neuroinflammatory markers were already elevated in juvenile mice although at this age the number of dopaminergic neurons was still unaffected, thus preceding the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. More neuroinflammatory markers were blunted in mice deficient for inflammasomes than in mice deficient for signalling by type I interferons. Neurodegeneration, however, was blunted in both mice. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that chronic activation of the STING pathway is sufficient to cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Targeting the STING pathway could therefore be beneficial in Parkinson's disease and further neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract = {The hypothalamus is a brain region that plays a key role in coordinating fundamental biological functions1. However, our understanding of the underlying cellular components and neurocircuitries have, until recently, emerged primarily from rodent studies2,3. Here we combine single-nucleus sequencing of 433,369 human hypothalamic cells with spatial transcriptomics, generating a comprehensive spatio-cellular transcriptional map of the hypothalamus, the `HYPOMAP'. Although conservation of neuronal cell types between humans and mice, as~based on transcriptomic identity, is generally high, there are notable exceptions. Specifically, there are significant disparities in the identity of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons and in the expression levels of G-protein-coupled receptors between the two species that carry direct implications for currently approved obesity treatments. Out of the 452 hypothalamic cell types, we find that~291 neuronal clusters are significantly enriched for expression of body mass index (BMI) genome-wide association study genes. This enrichment is driven by 426 `effector' genes. Rare deleterious variants in six of these (MC4R, PCSK1, POMC, CALCR, BSN and CORO1A) associate with BMI at population level, and CORO1A has not been linked previously to BMI. Thus, HYPOMAP provides a detailed atlas of the human hypothalamus in a spatial context and serves as an important resource to identify new druggable targets for treating a wide range of conditions, including reproductive, circadian and metabolic disorders.},

Each OSN expresses only one functional OR species, which is referred to as the ``one neuron--one receptor'' rule. Furthermore, OSN axons bearing the same OR converge to a specific projection site in the olfactory bulb (OB) forming a glomerular structure, i.e., the ``one glomerulus--one receptor'' rule. Based on these basic rules, binding signals of odorants detected by OSNs are converted to topographic information of activated glomeruli in the OB. During development, the glomerular map is formed by the combination of two genetically programmed processes: one is OR-independent projection along the dorsal--ventral axis, and the other is OR-dependent projection along the anterior-posterior axis. The map is further refined in an activity-dependent manner during the neonatal period. Here, we summarize recent progress of neural map formation in the mouse olfactory system.},

To facilitate their study, we developed a method to generate 40--60\% human LC-NE neurons from human pluripotent stem cells. The approach depends on our identification of ACTIVIN A in regulating LC-NE transcription factors in dorsal rhombomere 1 (r1) progenitors.

Even though the genetic heterogeneity among these cell types are documented, unidentified cell populations arising from the olfactory placode remain. One candidate to identify placodal derived neurons in the developing nasal area is the transcription factor Isl1, which was recently identified in GnRH-3 neurons of the terminal nerve in fish, as well as expression in neurons of the nasal migratory mass. Here, we analyzed the Isl1 genetic lineage in chemosensory neuronal populations in the nasal area and migratory GnRH-1 neurons in mice using in-situ hybridization, immunolabeling a Tamoxifen inducible Isl1CreERT and a constitutive Isl1Cre knock-in mouse lines. In addition, we also performed conditional Isl1 ablation in developing GnRH neurons. We found Isl1 lineage across non sensory cells of the respiratory epithelium and sustentacular cells of OE and VNO. We identified a population of transient embryonic Isl1+ neurons in the olfactory epithelium and sparse Isl1+ neurons in postnatal VNO. Isl1 is expressed in almost all GnRH neurons and in approximately half of the other neuron populations in the Migratory Mass. However, Isl1 conditional ablation alone does not significantly compromise GnRH-1 neuronal migration or GnRH-1 expression, suggesting compensatory mechanisms. Further studies will elucidate the functional and mechanistic role of Isl1 in development of migratory endocrine neurons.},

These processes are modulated by extracellular matrix components, such as heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharides. HS is molecularly complex as a result of nonrandom modifications of the sugar moieties, including sulfations in specific positions. We report here mutations in HS 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS6ST1) in families with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). IHH manifests as incomplete or absent puberty and infertility as a result of defects in gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuron development or function. IHH-associated HS6ST1 mutations display reduced activity in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that HS6ST1 and the complex modifications of extracellular sugars are critical for normal development in humans. Genetic experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans reveal that HS cell-specifically regulates neural branching in vivo in concert with other IHH-associated genes, including kal-1, the FGF receptor, and FGF. These findings are consistent with a model in which KAL1 can act as a modulatory coligand with FGF to activate the FGF receptor in an HS-dependent manner.},

Minipuberty has been described in female as a first postnatal period of gonadotropic axis activation. We transiently disrupted the minipubertal period, using daily injections of GnRH antagonist or aromatase inhibitor. The results showed unchanged puberty initiation and mild disturbance of estrus cyclicity. Minor modifications of some components of sexual behavior (olfactory preference, ability to attract male) were observed, but had no impact on lordosis behavior. Interestingly, letrozole-treated female mice showed increased anxiety state level at adulthood. This period therefore does not seem to be a key organizational window for female sexual behavior but appears to participate in the organization of neural structures involved in anxiety-related behavior.},

One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

However, how endogenously generated networks respond to the onset of sensory experience and how they form mature sensory representations with experience remain unclear. In this study, we examined this `nature--nurture transform' at the single-trial level using chronic in vivo calcium imaging in ferret visual cortex. At eye opening, visual stimulation evokes robust patterns of modular cortical network activity that are highly variable within and across trials, severely limiting stimulus discriminability. These initial stimulus-evoked modular patterns are distinct from spontaneous network activity patterns present before and at the time of eye opening. Within a week of normal visual experience, cortical networks develop low-dimensional, highly reliable stimulus representations that correspond with reorganized patterns of spontaneous activity. Using a computational model, we propose that reliable visual representations derive from the alignment of feedforward and recurrent cortical networks shaped by novel patterns of visually driven activity.},

  abstract = {Primary olfactory neurons arise from placodal neuroepithelium that is separate from the neuroepithelial plate that forms the neural tube and crest. The axons of these neurons course along a stereotypical pathway and invade the rostral telencephalic vesicle where they induce the formation of the olfactory bulb. In the present study we examined the expression of several extracellular matrix constituents during formation of the olfactory nerve pathway in order to identify putative developmentally significant molecules. Double-label immunofluorescence was used to simultaneously map the trajectory of growing primary olfactory axons by expression of growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and the distribution of either laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG). At embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) primary olfactory axons have exited the olfactory neuroepithelium of the nasal pit and formed a rudimentary olfactory nerve. These axons together with migrating neural cells form a large mass outside the rostral surface of the telencephalon. This nerve pathway is clearly defined by a punctate distribution of laminin and HSPG. CSPG is selectively present in the mesenchyme between the olfactory nerve pathway and the nasal pit and in the marginal zone of the telencephalon. At E14.5 primary olfactory axons pierce the telencephalon through gaps that have emerged in the basement membrane. At this age both laminin and HSPG are colocalized with the primary olfactory axons that have entered the marginal zone of the telencephalon. CSPG expression becomes downregulated in this same region while it remains highly expressed in the marginal zone adjacent to the presumptive olfactory bulb. By E16.5 most of the basement membrane separating the olfactory nerve from the telencephalon has degraded, and there is direct continuity between the olfactory nerve pathway and the central nervous system. This strict spatiotemporal regulation of extracellular matrix constituents in the olfactory nerve pathway supports an important role of these molecules in axon guidance. We propose that laminin and HSPG are expressed by migrating olfactory Schwann cells in the developing olfactory nerve pathway and that these molecules provide a conducive substrate for axon growth between the olfactory neuroepithelium and the brain. CSPG in the surrounding mesenchyme may act to restrict axon growth to within this pathway. The regional degradation of the basement membrane of the telencephalon and the downregulation of CSPG within the marginal zone probably facilitates the passage of primary olfactory axons into the brain to form the presumptive nerve fiber layer of the olfactory bulb. {\copyright} 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Several excellent reviews have detailed the conservation of principles between insect, amphibian, and mammalian olfactory systems, and many important contributions to the field have been made by cross-phyla comparisons. However, within the limitations of this reference, in this chapter we will emphasize embryonic development and axon targeting in the rodent olfactory system, focusing on the mouse. To aide comparisons between studies in other rodents, the developmental ages in studies in the rat will be adjusted and referred to as the equivalent developmental age in mice. We apologize for any papers we may have missed or not had the opportunity to discuss in detail due to space limitations. The olfactory system is one of the most precocious sensory systems to develop in the embryo. The primary olfactory pathway is comprised of two components, the olfactory epithelium (OE) and the olfactory bulb (OB). The secondary olfactory pathway includes multiple cortical regions, all of which are directly innervated by OB projection neurons, and are collectively referred to as the olfactory cortex. Major regions of the olfactory cortex include the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), the olfactory tubercle, the piriform cortex, and the entorhinal cortex (reviewed in Wilson et al. 2006). These regions are innervated by mitral and/or tufted cell axons via the lateral olfactory tract (LOT). During the earliest stages of primary olfactory pathway formation, the OE and the OB undergo simultaneous, yet independent, developmental programs (Lopez-Mascaraque and De Castro 2002). However, as development progresses and axons from the OE innervate the nascent OB, their developmental programs become interrelated (Treloar et al. 1999; Matsutani and Yamamoto 2000; Lopez-Mascaraque et al. 2005). The early separation in developmental programs is perhaps not surprising given the spatial segregation of the regions that give rise to these two structures (see below). Despite a common ectodemal origin, the OE (the peripheral component of the olfactory system) is derived from the olfactory placode, while the OB emerges from the germinal zones of the neural tube, like other central nervous system (CNS) structures.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Estrogen receptor (ER) {$\alpha$} is involved in several estrogen-modulated neural and peripheral functions. To determine its role in the expression of female and male reproductive behavior, a mouse line lacking the               ER{$\alpha$}               in the nervous system was generated. Mutant females did not exhibit sexual behavior despite normal olfactory preference, and had a reduced number of progesterone receptor-immunoreactive neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus. Mutant males displayed a moderately impaired sexual behavior and unaffected fertility, despite evidences of altered organization of sexually dimorphic populations in the preoptic area. In comparison, males deleted for both neural               ER{$\alpha$}               and androgen receptor (               AR               ) displayed greater sexual deficiencies. Thus, these data highlight a predominant role for neural               ER{$\alpha$}               in females and a complementary role with the AR in males in the regulation of sexual behavior, and provide a solid background for future analyses of neuronal versus glial implication of these signaling pathways in both sexes.},

The findings highlight that a specific subtype of bacterial vaginosis (BV), identified from 16S rRNA gene reads using the molBV algorithm and community state type (CST) clustering, is a significant risk factor for CT acquisition. A microbial risk score (MRS) further identified a network of bacterial genera associated with increased CT risk. Post treatment, the CVM associated with CT acquisition re-emerged in a different subset of cases leading to reinfection. Additionally, the analysis showed a connection between post-treatment CVM and the development of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and miscarriage, further underscoring the CVM's contributing role to incident CT natural history and highlighting its consideration as a therapeutic target.},

To examine this, we tracked the same population of hippocampal CA1 place cells (PCs) as mice learned a task for 7\,days. We found evidence of memory formation as both the number of PCs maintaining a stable place field and the stability of individual PCs progressively increased across the week until most of the representation was composed of long-term stable PCs. The stable PCs disproportionately represented task-related learned information, were retrieved earlier within a behavioral session and showed a strong correlation with behavioral performance. Both the initial formation of PCs and their retrieval on subsequent days were accompanied by prominent signs of behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), suggesting that even stable PCs were re-formed by synaptic plasticity each session. Further experimental evidence supported by a cascade-type state model indicates that CA1 PCs increase their stability each day they are active, eventually forming a highly stable population. The results suggest that CA1 memory is implemented by an increase in the likelihood of new neuron-specific synaptic plasticity, as opposed to extensive long-term synaptic weight stabilization.},

At the cell bodies, inhibition leads and is stronger than excitation across the entire theta cycle. Pyramidal neurons fire on the ascending phase of theta when released from inhibition. Computational models equipped with the observed conductances reproduce these dynamics. In these models, place field properties are favored when the increased excitation is coupled with a reduction of inhibition within the field. As predicted by our simulations, firing rate within place fields and phase locking to theta are impaired by DREADDs activation of interneurons.

In contrast to this ``negative gain,'' optogenetic probing showed increased within-field excitability in place cells by weakening I and unmasked stable place fields in initially non--place cells. Neuronal assemblies active during sharp-wave ripples in the home cage predicted spatial overlap and sequences of place fields of both place cells and unmasked preexisting place fields of non--place cells during track running.

These proteins are now known to have pleiotropic effects affecting different stages of neuron migration, from promoting cell mobility to acting as stop signals. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how canonical axon guidance proteins influence migrating neurons with a particular focus on recent insights into how neuron migration is controlled in the GnRH system and cortex, and the multifunctional role of Netrin-1. At the molecular level, tight control of receptor expression and crosstalk, and interactions with the extracellular matrix have recently been implicated in neuron migration control.}

In our task, mice navigated using ambiguous landmarks that are identified through their mutual spatial relationship, requiring sequential refinement of hypotheses. Neurons in RSC and in artificial neural networks encoded mixtures of hypotheses, location and sensory information, and were constrained by robust low-dimensional dynamics. RSC encoded hypotheses as locations in activity space with divergent trajectories for identical sensory inputs, enabling their correct interpretation. Our results indicate that interactions between internal hypotheses and external sensory data in recurrent circuits can provide a substrate for complex sequential cognitive reasoning.},

Targeted deficiency throughout the mitochondrial quality control pathway, including genome integrity, dynamics, or turnover, impaired the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, activating the mitochondrial integrated stress response, eliciting chromatin remodeling, and promoting cellular immaturity rather than apoptosis to yield metabolic dysfunction. Indeed, pharmacologic blockade of the integrated stress response in vivo restored {$\beta$}-cell identity following loss of mitochondrial quality control. Targeting mitochondrial retrograde signaling may therefore be promising in the treatment or prevention of metabolic disorders.},

During 6 months in microgravity, resorption was threefold higher than formation.

Here we collected paired single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and transcriptome data from 38 human neocortical samples encompassing both the prefrontal cortex and the primary visual cortex. These samples span five main developmental stages, ranging from the first trimester to adolescence. In parallel, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis on a subset of the samples to illustrate spatial organization and intercellular communication. This atlas enables us to catalogue cell-type-specific, age-specific and area-specific gene regulatory networks underlying neural differentiation. Moreover, combining single-cell profiling, progenitor purification and lineage-tracing experiments, we have untangled the complex lineage relationships among progenitor subtypes during the neurogenesis-to-gliogenesis transition. We identified a tripotential intermediate progenitor subtype---tripotential intermediate progenitor cells (Tri-IPCs)---that is responsible for the local production of GABAergic neurons, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes. Notably, most glioblastoma cells resemble Tri-IPCs at the transcriptomic level, suggesting that cancer cells hijack developmental processes to enhance growth and heterogeneity. Furthermore, by integrating our atlas data with large-scale genome-wide association study data, we created a disease-risk map highlighting enriched risk associated with autism spectrum disorder in second-trimester intratelencephalic neurons. Our study sheds light on the molecular and cellular dynamics of the developing human neocortex.},

We show that Th+ cNTS neurons encode esophageal mechanical distension and transient gulp size via vagal afferent inputs, providing quick feedback regulation of ingestion speed. By contrast, Gcg+ cNTS neurons monitor intestinal nutrients and cumulative ingested calories and have long-term effects on food satiation and preference. These nutritive signals are conveyed through a portal vein--spinal ascending pathway rather than vagal sensory neurons. Our findings underscore distinctions among cNTS subtypes marked by differences in temporal dynamics, sensory modalities, associated visceral organs and ascending sensory pathways, all of which contribute to specific functions in coordinated feeding regulation.},

Using a computational approach, we designed variants of SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and selected 7 natural sarbecovirus RBDs, each predicted to fold properly and abrogate antibody responses to variable epitopes. RBDs were attached to 60-mer nanoparticles to make immunogens displaying two (mosaic-2COMs), five (mosaic-5COM), or seven (mosaic-7COM) different RBDs for comparisons with mosaic-8b, which elicited cross-reactive antibodies and protected animals from sarbecovirus challenges. Naive and COVID-19 prevaccinated mice immunized with mosaic-7COM elicited antibodies targeting conserved RBD epitopes, and their sera exhibited higher binding and neutralization titers against sarbecoviruses than mosaic-8b. Mosaic-2COMs and mosaic-5COM elicited higher antibody potencies against some SARS-CoV-2 variants than mosaic-7COM. However, mosaic-7COM elicited more potent responses against zoonotic sarbecoviruses and highly mutated Omicrons, supporting its use to protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants and zoonotic sarbecoviruses.},

  abstract = {Tau pathology is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. However, the sequence of events and the form of tau that confers toxicity are still unclear, due in large part to the lack of physiological models of tauopathy initiation and progression in which to test hypotheses. We have developed a series of targeted mice expressing frontotemporal-dementia-causing mutations in the humanized MAPT gene to investigate the earliest stages of tauopathy. MAPTInt10+3G{$>$}A and MAPTS305N;Int10+3G{$>$}A lines show abundant hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, but they do not develop seed-competent fibrillar structures. Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau was accompanied by neurite degeneration, loss of viable synapses and indicators of behavioral abnormalities. Our results demonstrate that neuronal toxicity can occur in the absence of fibrillar, higher-order structures and that tau hyperphosphorylation is probably involved in the earliest etiological events in tauopathies showing isoform ratio imbalance.},

  abstract = {During the initial assembly of the olfactory pathway, the behavior of olfactory axons changes as they grow from the olfactory epithelium toward the telencephalic vesicle. The axons exit the epithelium singly or in small fascicles, and their growth cones are simple and bullet-shaped. Outside the epithelium, they make a sharp dorsal turn and fasciculate into a single nerve; the growth cones remain simple. Upon entering the ventromedial telencephalon, the axons defasciculate, branch extensively, and end in complex, lamellate growth cones which extend toward the ventrolateral aspect of the telencephalic vesicle. The distribution of laminin, collagen-IV, and fibronectin varies in register with these changes in olfactory axon and growth cone behavior. Each of these extracellular matrix molecules influences olfactory neurite outgrowth and growth cone morphology in vitro consistent with its distribution in vivo. The distribution of E-cadherin, L1, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and the polysialated form of NCAM also varies in register with changes in olfactory axon behavior. In vitro, L1 modulates embryonic olfactory neurite outgrowth and growth cone morphology consistent with its distribution in vivo. Thus, olfactory axon trajectory, fasciculation, and growth cone morphology change within distinct adhesive environments in the nascent olfactory pathway, and some of the molecules that characterize these environments have differential effects upon olfactory neurite growth and growth cone morphology. Consequently, the patterned expression and activity of extracellular matrix and cell surface adhesion molecules may contribute to the initial assembly of the olfactory pathway. {\copyright} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Initially, they migrate along with the vomeronasal nerve into the brain at the cribriform plate, then progress caudally to sites within the hypothalamus where they halt and send projections to the median eminence to activate pituitary gonadotropes. Many factors controlling this precise journey have been elucidated by the silencing or over expression of candidate genes in mouse models. Importantly, a number of these factors may not only play a role in normal physiology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis but also be mis-expressed to cause human disorders of GnRH deficiency, presenting as a failure to undergo normal pubertal development. This review outlines the current cadre of candidates thought to modulate GnRH neuronal migration. The further elucidation and characterization of these factors that impact GnRH neuron development may shed new light on human reproductive disorders and provide potential targets to develop new pro-fertility or contraceptive agents.},

Here, we leverage a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-based yeast sensor strain to generate sensors for seven ORs highly expressed in the colon. We screen the seven colon ORs against 57 chemicals likely to bind ORs in olfactory tissue. We successfully deorphanize two colon exORs for the first time, OR2T4 and OR10S1, and find alternative ligands for OR2A7. The same OR deorphanization workflow can be applied to the deorphanization of other ORs and GPCRs in general. Identification of ligands for OR2T4, OR10S1, and OR2A7 will enable the study of these ORs in the colon. Additionally, the colon OR-based sensors will enable the elucidation of endogenous colon metabolites that activate these receptors. Finally, deorphanization of OR2T4 and OR10S1 supports studies of the neuroscience of olfaction.},

We hypothesized that FGF8 regulates differentiation of human GnRH neurons in a time- and dose-dependent manner via FGFR1. To investigate this further, human pluripotent stem cells were differentiated during 10\>days of dual-SMAD inhibition into neural progenitor cells, followed either by treatment with FGF8 at different concentrations (25\>ng/ml, 50\>ng/ml or 100\>ng/ml) for 10\>days or by treatment with 100\>ng/ml FGF8 for different durations (2, 4, 6 or 10\>days); cells were then matured through DAPT-induced inhibition of Notch signaling for 5\>days into GnRH neurons. FGF8 induced expression of GNRH1 in a dose-dependent fashion and the duration of FGF8 exposure correlated positively with gene expression of GNRH1 (P\&lt;0.05, Rs=0.49). However, cells treated with 100\>ng/ml FGF8 for 2\>days induced the expression of genes, such as FOXG1, ETV5 and SPRY2, and continued FGF8 treatment induced the dynamic expression of several other genes. Moreover, during exposure to FGF8, FGFR1 localized to the cell surface and its specific inhibition with the FGFR1 inhibitor PD166866 reduced expression of GNRH1 (P\&lt;0.05). In neurons, FGFR1 also localized to the nucleus. Our results suggest that dose- and time-dependent FGF8 signaling via FGFR1 is indispensable for human GnRH neuron ontogeny.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.},

In our study, we found that Canopy homolog 2 (CNPY2) is increased in NSCLC tissues compared to the normal lung tissues, and the upregulation of CNPY2 is correlated with poor survival. Next, colony formation, annexin V-binding and TUNEL assays revealed that overexpression of CNPY2 inhibits the apoptosis of NSCLC cells induced by cisplatin. Further assays demonstrated that the anti-apoptosis may be aroused by the hyperactivation of NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling pathway, and blocking the NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway promotes the apoptosis of CNPY2-upregulating cells. The above results suggest that CNPY2 can serves as a therapeutic target to promote the effect of chemotherapy in NSCLC.},

  abstract = {Cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, also called insulin-like growth factor two receptor (CIM6P/IGF2R), plays important roles in growth and development, but is also extensively expressed in the mature nervous system, particularly in the hippocampus, where its functions are largely unknown. One of its major ligands, IGF2, is critical for long-term memory formation and strengthening. Using CIM6P/IGF2R inhibition in rats and neuron-specific knockdown in mice, here we show that hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R is necessary for hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation, but dispensable for learning, memory retrieval, and reconsolidation. CIM6P/ IGF2R controls the training-induced upregulation of de novo protein synthesis, including increase of Arc, Egr1, and c-Fos proteins, without affecting their mRNA induction. Hippocampal or systemic administration of mannose-6-phosphate, like IGF2, significantly enhances memory retention and persistence in a CIM6P/IGF2R-dependent manner. Thus, hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R plays a critical role in memory consolidation by controlling the rate of training-regulated protein metabolism and is also a target mechanism for memory enhancement.},

  abstract = {The mammalian sense of smell relies upon a vast array of receptor proteins to detect odorant compounds present in the environment. The proper deployment of these receptor proteins in olfactory sensory neurons is orchestrated by a suite of epigenetic processes that remodel the olfactory genes in differentiating neuronal progenitors. The goal of this review is to elucidate the central role of gene regulatory processes acting in neuronal progenitors of olfactory sensory neurons that lead to a singular expression of an odorant receptor in mature olfactory sensory neurons. We begin by describing the principal features of odorant receptor gene expression in mature olfactory sensory neurons. Next, we delineate our current understanding of how these features emerge from multiple gene regulatory mechanisms acting in neuronal progenitors. Finally, we close by discussing the key gaps in our understanding of how these regulatory mechanisms work and how they interact with each other over the course of differentiation.},

We analyzed the transcriptional profiles of over 400,000 cells from 14 human samples collected from post-conceptional weeks (PCW) 3 to 12 to delineate the dynamic molecular and cellular landscape of early gastrulation and nervous system development. We described the diversification of cell types, the spatial patterning of neural tube cells, and the signaling pathways likely involved in transforming epiblast cells into neuroepithelial cells and then into radial glia. We resolved 24 clusters of radial glial cells along the neural tube and outlined differentiation trajectories for the main classes of neurons. Lastly, we identified conserved and distinctive features across species by comparing early embryonic single-cell transcriptomic profiles between humans and mice. This comprehensive atlas sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying gastrulation and early human brain development.},

  abstract = {Key features of long-term memory (LTM), such as its stability and persistence, are acquired during processes collectively referred to as consolidation. The dynamics of biological changes during consolidation are complex. In adult rodents, consolidation exhibits distinct periods during which the engram is more or less resistant to disruption. Moreover, the ability to consolidate memories differs during developmental periods. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying consolidation are poorly understood, the initial stages rely on interacting signaling pathways that regulate gene expression, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Ca               2+               /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II {$\alpha$} (CaMKII{$\alpha$}) dependent feedback loops. We investigated the ways in which these pathways may contribute to developmental and dynamical features of consolidation. A computational model of molecular processes underlying consolidation following inhibitory avoidance (IA) training in rats was developed. Differential equations described the actions of CaMKII{$\alpha$}, multiple feedback loops regulating BDNF expression, and several transcription factors including methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), and SIN3 transcription regulator family member A (Sin3a). This model provides novel explanations for the (apparent) rapid forgetting of infantile memory and the temporal progression of memory consolidation in adults. Simulations predict that dual effects of MeCP2 on the expression of               bdnf               , and interaction between MeCP2 and CaMKII{$\alpha$}, play critical roles in the rapid forgetting of infantile memory and the progress of memory resistance to disruptions. These insights suggest new potential targets of therapy for memory impairment.},

However, subunit assembly and molecular architecture of endogenous NMDARs (eNMDARs) in the brain remain elusive. Using conformation- and subunit-dependent antibodies, we purified eNMDARs from adult rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Three major subtypes of GluN1-N2A-N2B, GluN1-N2B, and GluN1-N2A eNMDARs were resolved by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) at the resolution up to 4.2 A{\r{}} . The particle ratio of these three subtypes was 9:7:4, indicating that about half of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits are incorporated into the triheterotetramers. Structural analysis revealed the asymmetric architecture of the GluN1-N2A-N2B receptor throughout the extracellular to the transmembrane layers. Moreover, the conformational variations between GluN1-N2B and GluN1-N2A-N2B receptors revealed the distinct biophysical properties across different eNMDAR subtypes. Our findings imply the structural and functional complexity of eNMDARs and shed light on structure-based therapeutic design targeting these eNMDARs in vivo.},

In mice, reward and its prediction activate the SVTg, and SVTg stimulation leads to place preference, reduced anxiety, and accumbal dopamine release. Mice self-stimulate the SVTg, which can also be activated directly by the neocortex, resulting in effective inhibition of the lateral habenula, a region associated with depression. This mechanism may also explain why SVTg suppression induces aversion and increases fear. The translational relevance of these findings is supported by evidence in the rat, monkey, and human brainstem, establishing SVTg as a key hub for reward processing, emotional valence, and motivation.},

In the present study, we tested between these two models by asking how schema correlates in rat OFC would be affected by inactivating the output of the HC, after learning and during transfer across problems. We found that the prevalence and content of schema correlates were unaffected by inactivating one major HC output area, the ventral subiculum, after learning, whereas inactivation during transfer accelerated their formation. These results favor the proposal that the OFC and HC operate in parallel to extract different features defining cognitive maps and schemas.},

Here, we present a highly-configurable function that produces publication-ready volcano plots. EnhancedVolcano will attempt to fit as many point labels in the plot window as possible, thus avoiding 'clogging' up the plot with labels that could not otherwise have been read. Other functionality allows the user to identify up to 4 different types of attributes in the same plot space via colour, shape, size, and shade parameter configurations.},
